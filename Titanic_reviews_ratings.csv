0,Very beautiful and cinematic movie with lots of classic scenes.Also extremely sad at times.Absolute 90's classic.,10
1,"Ah, yes, the film that propelled Leonardi DiCapro to super stardom, became the first film to gross $1 billion, and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years (only to be kicked off the top by another James Cameron film, Avatar).It is said 'Titanic' is the film with the most continuity errors of all films. Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing! The sinking of the Titanic was the greatest ship sinking scene EVER and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship. Off course, that was not the case, though, as it were all (very elaborate) sets, most of which were destroyed during the making of the film.Leonardo made for a very likable hero, quite frankly one a lot of guys can relate to. The young lovers were so different and yet so alike, and their love story was almost endearing. I must admit, the jumping backwards and forwards in time was a bit unnecessary and resulted in an overlong epic. They should only have told the 1912 story. Apart from that, the film was thrilling, exciting and fascinating in every sense of the word!",10
2,"Back in 1997, do I remember that year: Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo's real nose? OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, it delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyage.The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean. Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101-year-old Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic, revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater. In 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old Rose boards the ship with her controlling fiancé, Cal Hockley and her desperate for money mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater. Distraught and frustrated by her engagement, Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes who convinces her not to jump. Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a first-class formal dinner of the wealthy for a much livelier gathering of dancing, music and beer in third-class. After revealing their love for each other and wish to leave together when the ship docks, they then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg and now must escape together.So does Titanic live up to it's hype? I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and Leo Mania was born at the time. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but please don't let the haters bother you from watching this great movie. It has great acting, amazing effects, beautiful costumes, outstanding sets, a well-written story and still looks flawless. Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of Leo's baby face or Kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. Otherwise I don't think we'd still be talking about it so many years later. Kate and Leo had this amazing chemistry that in my opinion made it one of the greatest love stories of all time. Despite the story not being the most original with the rich girl loves poor boy plot, I think it worked extremely well because they fit so well together. James Cameron, the extreme perfectionist that he is, went over time and money budgets for Titanic, but this was his baby and it paid off very well. James had captured everything about Titanic and the sinking so well. He respectfully shows what terror the victims went through that night and made sure that this wasn't just a love story but to remember those who lost their lives on the tragic voyage. He had every right in my opinion to scream ""I'm king of the world!"" at the Oscars, because this movie blew everyone out of the water(no pun intended), you know what? I'm going to admit it, I love Titanic, even past my teen years I absolutely adore this movie, it will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too since I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. Remember one thing, be true to yourself, don't follow the crowd, lovers or haters, if you go with the hype you're always going to go crazy over a film before viewing it, then if you thought the film was just alright for some reason it comes off as the worst movie ever. I do recommend Titanic, it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.10/10",10
3,"The stage curtains open ...Not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""Braveheart"", have I ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as I was with ""Titanic"". I knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but I had no idea the ride I was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. I have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that I've read/heard when it come to this epic film. Because, it is just that - epic in every way, shape or form.We follow along as a young wayfarer named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins a ticket to board the Titanic in a game of chance. During its fateful voyage, he meets and falls for an upper-class girl named Rose (Kate Winslet). Under the thumb of her demanding fiance (Billy Zane) and her narrow-minded mother, Rose is introduced to a different side to life by Jack, and he helps her to find her own individuality and independence, alienating her from a life that she already despises. She must now decide if she'll choose to stay where she is, or leave and have a life with Jack - a decision that is further compounded when the mighty ship strikes an iceberg leading to the eye popping conclusion.What makes this film work is the love story. A lot of the negative reviews I've read complain because there is a love story. But, without it, this movie doesn't work. I am not interested in watching a biography about the Titanic, I want a good story - and this movie certainly delivers that. I was completely invested in Jack and Rose, and when the ship began to sink, I was with them both every step of the way.I highly recommend this movie at 10 stars out of 10. The event of the ship sinking alone was awe inspiring. You are right there in the scene. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The direction is tight, the special effects phenomenal, and the acting completely believable. DiCaprio and Winslet had perfect chemistry. I was affected and moved by ""Titanic"". And even knowing the outcome, I will happily get on board again and again.",10
4,"Good Lord. This movie right here, it's a masterpiece. I am not exaggerating when I say this. Tonight was the first time I watched this. I watched some parts of it earlier, but I thought it would probably be boring, and that I had better things to do. Tonight I watched the whole thing with my grandmother. I was completely wrong on that. This was the best movie that I've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. Me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. There were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""Nearer, My God, to Thee"" and the end when all those perished on the Titanic applaud at the kiss of Rose and Jack. This movie was absolutely amazing and I would watch it over and over again.",10
5,"I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece.",10
6,"""Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.However, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay film this is not, as Cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it. Watching the Titanic being destroyed is not fun or, in its broadest sense, exciting - it's intensely distressing. Unlike most disaster films, it never feels like we're watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around. The lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period, such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character. And when the ship sinks, it genuinely shocks you to see them go. For a good part of the sinking, Jack and Rose's fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side, giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night.So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.",10
7,"""Titanic"" won a bazillion Oscars and is considered a classic by many. And, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. So, what more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Well, very little--that is why this review is rather short.I give the film a 9 because it isn't perfect. Some of the characters, to me, seemed a bit simplistic. But, no matter if you like them or not, there's no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn't exactly a spoiler!) are amazing. So, like the story or not, the film is staggering to watch--particularly on a big screen. And, now that I think about this, this is exactly how I viewed director Cameron's other huge success, ""Avatar"". Well worth seeing once.",9
8,"The low rating makes no sense to me at all... This movie is magnificent, so well made, the acting is superb. Anything below 9 doesn't do it any justice.",10
9,"To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it?  IF you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that's your loss.  The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think.  I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book.  It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted.  I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that?  It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet.  I will gladly side with the majority this time around. Okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done.",10
10,"I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. ""It was so great,"" she said. ""You really felt like you were on the ship."" ""Nonsense,"" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, ""you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested."" ""Well, maybe,"" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. ""OK,"" I thought, ""I'll give it a look see."" I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.Where to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost ""you are there"" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect ""t"" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of ""My Heart Goes On.""Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats. A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.9/10",9
11,"You can watch this movie in 1997, you can watch it again in 2004 or 2009 or you can watch it in 2015 or 2020, and this movie will get you EVERY TIME. Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding! Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!",10
12,"Titanic is one of my all time favourite films. I'm a 24 year old guy who has probably not cried in front of anyone since I was a kid, but this movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. We all know the ship will sink (does that even qualify as a spoiler?) but the build-up to this event - the smugness and over- confidence, assurances of it being ""unsinkable"" - tease the audience, almost to the point where you're like 'is it really going to sink?'I thought the performances of everyone were magnificent: I cared about the characters and their lives on and beyond the ship. Taking the time to introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful, even beyond the main characters, like Fabrizio and Murdoch the First Officer and countless more. It was heartbreaking towards the end when you see the panic gradually set in, and it slowly descends into total chaos. You remember Jack telling Rose all the places he's going to take her to and you imagine their love- filled lives together. The Irish mother telling her children the fairytale, resigned to their fate. The violinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage. And the music! Wow. I cried for all of this. And especially right at the end when you see the photos of Rose's life, knowing she's fulfilled her promise and survived, living a full life, probably never having met anyone she loved as much as Jack all those years ago.Visually pleasing in every way, dramatic, musically astounding, great acting and above all a fantastic story make this an undeniably iconic, enduring film. A romantic-drama unlike any other. It deserves higher than 7.7.",10
13,"This movie re-wrote film history in every way.  No one cares what anyone thinks about this movie, because it transcends criticism.  Every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it.  It is an extremely beautiful movie, and I doubt many of us will see anything like it again. I've seen it more times than I care to count, and I still become transfixed every time, with a feeling which is hard to describe.  One for the ages.",10
14,"James Cameron's 'Titanic' shares a similar motto to Marmite, ""you either love it or hate it"", I for one love this film, yes I know it's got a drawn out romance story, but there's just something about the 3-hour fill of the film that makes its such a spectacularly emotional and beautiful movie. I saw this a lot when I was growing up, this was one of the films of my childhood, it is truly a powerfully resonant and visually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour the British original 'A Night to Remember', but this is a pretty close contender. Winner of 11 Oscars, James Cameron's romantic-disaster epic is a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate and Leo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this film nowadays solely because it's become the most popular film ever made alongside Cameron's other epic 'Avatar', and whilst 'Titanic' is definitely not one of my favourite films, it's just so powerfully amazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone's eyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner's haunting score that was a key ingredient in the film's success, it is simply perfect, too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful pop version. Nonetheless, 'Titanic' is a modern classic and a beautifully spectacular film that will live on.",
15,"I am still crying as I am writing this review as of right now. I don't even know where to begin. I can now see why this film was one of the highest grossing movies of all time. The blending of genres was masterfully done through the style of a Historical Romance/Drama, and a Disaster/Action film. The writing was absolutely superb, for a 3 hour movie I found myself completely engaged not even blinking my eye. The costumes, music, performances, characters, cinematography, dialogue was so magical I can't even put words here to describe the beauty of everything put into this movie. The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred. James Cameron you are and will always be one of the best filmmakers to ever live and this is your ultimate masterpiece.",10
16,"From ""Cavalcade"" in 1933 to ""Titanic"" in 1953, ""A Night to Remember"" in 1957 and ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" in 1964, the doom ship Titanic became a voyage of legendary, if tragic, proportions, and in the time leading up to its 85th year spawned a TV movie, a Broadway musical and this masterpiece which had audiences preparing to get tickets for it even before it was finished shooting. The reason is clear: James Cameron, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, the promise of effects like you'd never seen in any movie, and a Celine Dion song sung over the teaser trailer that would shoot her to super-stardom.This is told in flashback through the experiences of the 102 year old survivor Rose Calvert (veteran 1930's movie actress Gloria Stuart, nearly forgotten until cast in this), shocked to see a drawing of herself in pristine condition. The nude drawing of her as a young woman wearing a valuable diamond is found in a safe pulled from the ancient wreckage and she immediately notifies the explorers who are searching for more Titanic artifacts and stories. Arriving with pretty much every single belonging of hers as well as her doting granddaughter, Stuart winces in tears with a sudden memory, but insists on going on with her story.From there, we are swept back decades to the luxurious ship on its maiden and only voyage, and the huge vessel is grandly detailed and scaled as only an epic of this nature can scale it to be. Winslet is engaged to the vain Billy Zane, forced by her desperate mother (Frances Fisher) to tolerate him because they are broke and only have their ""name"" to benefit them. Fisher, obviously having married ""up"" , is ultra snobby to the neuvo riche Kathy Bates, and when she meets Jack Dawson (DiCaprio), she knows trouble lies ahead, and her demeanor is enough iceberg for any young lady. Dawson has saved young Roe from committing suicide in the icy waters below, and their first encounter turns into a love that you know can only end tragically.With real life Titanic passengers Brown, John Jacob Astor and his wife Madeline (which would be a great subject for a separate movie), Benjamin Guggenheim and Isadore and Ida Strauss (another subject that would be a touching film), this mixes in these real life characters with the fictional ones. Zane and his humorless right hand man (David Warner) are great villains, with Zane absolutely vile as he psychotically tries to maintain his stolen dignity when he loses his trophy wife to be to a commoner. Watching Zane go psychotic as he stoops to the depths of evil makes you wish he wouldn't make it off, but the writers have an even better plan for him.The film takes well over 90 minutes before the disaster sequences start, and from then on, it is a dizzying, sometimes headache inducing bit of tense moments as DiCaprio, locked to a metal pole to drowned for daring to love Winslet, struggles to be set free. It goes on a bit too long, but for first time viewers is truly frightening. There were buckets of tears being flowed at the Paramount Studios theater I saw this in prior to the release, and even after half a dozen or so viewings, it can still bring them on.Certainly this is filled with cliches, but they are the type of cliches that have worked since the days of the silent movies. This was probably the first film since ""Gone With the Wind"" to be considered a guaranteed Oscar winner, sweeping a good majority of them when it came out. In many ways,, this has very old fashioned ideals and is thus an old fashioned style movie, one of the last of its kind that still worked (""The Artist"" from 20 years later was a rare exception.) I can watch this once a year and still be emotionally turned to mush by it. That is what makes an instant classic.",10
17,Titanic is world famous. The film that broke every box office record on release and wore the box office champion crown for many years(until it was overtaken by Jim Cameron's Avatar) is special because not only does it showcase the Titanic disaster in all its glory the film is a technical achievement of the highest order. The sinking sequence is astonishing and it feels like you are watching the actual ship sink. The characters and actors are amazing and even with a large running length you never dare look at the watch. James Cameron is a master director and Titanic is his stamp of authority.,
18,People are crazy. They rate Avengers so high and they rate this masterpiece low? This is beyond absurd. You guys should encourage great filmmakers like this one not stupid ones like the super hero franchises. For the love of god.,10
19,"Firstly and foremostly, I am a guy, which (in most cases) means I did not go see Titanic to see DiCaprio...although I think he can be a great actor.  Reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters.  I went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the Cake.  I actually think a lot of the characters were done well; that is, by the time they die in freezing water, you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them.  But , by the time Titanic was over, I was sufficiently moved to make me tell people that it was a great movie.  Kate Winslet was good, Kathy Bates was perfect, Leo was ok (I'll give you people that - I've seen him shine like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries, Romeo & Juliet).  But ultimately, the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning.  Bravo to Cameron.  He didn't just show us a large ship sinking, he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing, drowning people; he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail.  I like detail in a movie.  Very impressive job.",
20,"I saw this movie opening day and it took my breath away. James Cameron's fictional story of Jack and Rose entwined with real life occurances was haunting and absolutely beautiful. He is an amazing director and writer that this movie would not have worked without him.Kate Winslet was stunning as Rose and this movie belonged to her as you couldn't imagine anyone else playing this role.Leonardo DiCaprio was really good as Jack and  he should have had an  an Oscar nomination for this role and the ever brilliant Billy Zane didn't disappoint in his role as Rose's fiance Cal. His portrayl of Cal was so evil that despite being an awful person, you couldn't help but feel sorry for him, especially when despite all his doings he loved Rose so much.
James Horner's music was just as haunting and he always lifts the movie he works on to the ultimate level.Kathy Bates was equally impressive in a small role and provided quite a few of the laughs of the film. Everything from the special effects, to the sets to the costumes were pure magic.This would have to be one of the most wonderful films of the 20th Century and one that will never be forgotten.",
21,"Flawless, enchanting, riveting, wondrous, totally out of this world. Astounding as this may sound, I've just now got around to watching ""Titanic,"" 23 years on, and I'm staggered at all that I've missed my whole life.Young love is the most wonderful theme to explore in a movie, but it's also the most difficult to depict beautifully and without too much cloying treacle. Couple that with the story of a young teenage girl in the bygone era of aristocrat families and arranged marriage, side saddles and corsets, outrageous class inequality and rich powerful men in control of everything and keeping women under their thumbs - and you get ""Titanic."" And James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet cracked it with a bang! They impressed. They dazzled. They shined.They took our breath away.",10
22,"It's really quite odd. When Titanic first came out,the reviews were mixed but the public generally loved it,those who disliked the film were definitely in the minority. Over the years,it has became somewhat fashionable to slag Titanic off,even if a great many of those people who did so were probably amongst those who made it such an enormous hit in the cinemas. Titanic is flawed,definitely,sometimes greatly so. However,it's also a tremendous achievement for it's director James Cameron. Mixing a real disaster with romance is harder to do than some might think. Maybe he did have a right to say ""I'm king of the world"" when the film won Best Picture at the Oscars. Just once.The modern day opening is excellent,making effective use of some of Cameron's real footage he took of the sunken Titanic. There is a real sense of mystery. Than we flash back to the Titanic being boarded,and the film stalls just a little for around two hours. The attention to detail is amazing {even all the cutlery matched,you know} and there is nothing wrong with an extremely slow build up to action-think of The Seven Samourai. However,the central romance between Leo and Kate is often badly written and unconvincing. For a start Kate's Rose would certainly not have done two things she does in the film as quickly as she did {Obviously thousands of teenage girls seeing the film in 1997 would disagree with my views}. We also have to suffer Cameron constantly labouring the point that the poor people on the ship are better than the rich people.However,the final 80 or so minutes,detailing the sinking,is simply brilliant film making. The suspense is built expertly,even though we know what will happen,and climaxes with some technical shots which are still impressive. Perhaps there is a little two much emphasis on the central couple,but there are some truly moving moments,and it really feels true,although of course Cameron did play with the facts a little here and there,as at least one descendant of one of the survivors has pointed out. The following sequence involving the boats is extremely haunting,with some especially good use of sound. As for the final scene,it does manage to be pretty moving,it's schmaltzy but it works {though hardly original,think of Somewhere In Time and various 40s romantic fantasies}.Titanic has some excellent use of CGI {watch out for the transitions from present to the past on the sunken ship} and one glaringly bad special effect-the iceberg which looks like polystyrene. James Horner's best selling score is really quite poor and only occasionally brings the emotion it should do. Performances are generally excellent and sometimes succeed in overcoming some thin characterisation {such as Billy Zane as Rose's fiancée,who even has to suffer with far too much eye make up!}Overall Titanic is still worth seeing,and sometimes it really does hit the heights that it should. It succeeds more than it fails,which is impressive in a film as ambitious as this.",
23,"I had few problems with this film, and I have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated. True, it is over three hours long, but I was amazed that it goes by so quickly. I don't think it is overrated at all, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent. The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. The last hour is extremely riveting, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music score by James Horner was lovely, though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic an 8.5/10. Bethany Cox.",8
24,"Titanic is the film ive viewed 2nd most of all, i am the kinda guy that can watche a good movie once every 2 to 3 months, and ive seen titanic some 25-30 times and i should know the storyline pretty well.when seeing this in the theater first time alone and the next night with my wife i was lost for words each time. my wife cried the whole night and well into the next night of this lovestory, and whenever i put this in the video, i know ill have the tv space for myself, cause she made a promise to never ever let herself into a mental state again as when watching it the first time.its not so much the act that does this film, its far too cliched' to become a marvel of acting, but its the heart and the cruelty of life and death that crushes my heart each time i see it. the last 15 minutes are the worst, and i usually stop when the flag goes below the surface of the ocean..the grumpy old man might be a cry-baby, but its worth it, the second highest on my ever best movie list",10
25,"James Cameron's 'Titanic' is essentially a romantic adventure with visual grandeur and magnificence, a timeless tragic love story set against the background of this major historical event... It's an astonishing movie that exemplifies hope, love and humanity... Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific on screen with big charisma... Conveying passion, trust, insouciance and ingenuity, he's a free-spirited wanderer with artistic pretensions, and a zest for life... Kate Winslet is absolutely lovely as the confused upper-class teen engaged to a nasty rich guy who finds herself, one night, plunged to the depths of despair...Billy Zane is an arrogant racist, abusive and ultra rich who would lie, cheat, steal, bribe with money or even use an innocent young child to escape defeat... He keeps a 56 carat blue diamond worn by Louis XVI...Kathy Bates is the legendary unsinkable Molly Brown, the richest woman in Denver, who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship...Frances Fisheris is the impecunious cold snobbish mother who, deathly afraid of losing her social stature, forces her daughter to become engaged to marry a rich, supercilious snob...Victor Garber is the master shipbuilder, the real-life character who attempts to fix time, to measure it, in a sense, to make it into history... Jonathan Hyde is the White Star Chairman who wants the Titanic to break the Trans-Atlantic speed record, in spite of warnings that icebergs may have floated into the hazardous northern crossing...Bill Paxton is the opportunistic undersea explorer in search for a very rare diamond called the ""Heart of the Ocean."" Gloria Stuart is the 101-year old woman who reveals a never-before told love story... The nightmare, the horror and the shock are imprinted upon her deeply lined face... 'Titanic' is loaded with luminous photography and sweeping visuals as the footage of the shipwrecked Ocean liner lying motionless on the ocean floor; the incredible transformation of the bow of the sunken 'Titanic' that takes the viewer back to 1912, revealing the meticulously re-created interiors; the first sight of the Titanic steamed steadily toward her date with destiny; the Titanic, leaving the Southampton dock, and some dolphins appear jumping, racing along in front of the luxurious ship; DeCaprio and Winslet flying at the ship's front rail in a gorgeous magic moment; the intertwining of past and present as Jack was drawing Rose on his paper, the camera zooms closely on young Rose's eye, only to transform its shape into Gloria Stuart's aged eye...Chilling scenes: Titanic's inevitable collision with destiny; James Cameronin one of the most terrifying sequences ever put on film takes us down with the Titanic, finally leaving us floundering in the icy water, screaming for help that never comes...Winner of 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is a gigantic epic where you don't just watch the film, you experience it! The visual effects are amazing, like no other film's... The decor is overwhelming... James Horner's music intensifies the emotions... The whole movie is hunting and involving, filled with a wide range of deep feelings... It's truly a moving tribute to those who lost their lives on that unfortunate ship...",10
26,Titanic is world famous. The film that broke every box office record on release and wore the box office champion crown for many years(until it was overtaken by Jim Cameron's Avatar) is special because not only does it showcase the Titanic disaster in all its glory the film is a technical achievement of the highest order. The sinking sequence is astonishing and it feels like you are watching the actual ship sink. The characters and actors are amazing and even with a large running length you never dare look at the watch. James Cameron is a master director and Titanic is his stamp of authority.,
27,"Every once in a while the conversation will turn to ""favorite movies."" I'll mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And they're too embarrassed now to admit it.I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people won't even admit they enjoyed it. Folks, let's get something straight -- you don't look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic.No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait 'til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed.This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, ""flying"". ""Iceberg, right ahead!"" The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.The music, which has also been a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.I confess, I am a Titanic buff. As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty. Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I've had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity.Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.",10
28,"When you have a film this big and successful, it just stands to reason that a number of people are going to try to bash it. Especially when it happens to be a romance. And sure enough, I am the only male I know who has anything positive at all to say about it. Is all of the criticism warranted? Let's see...Jim Cameron didn't need to create this huge-scale, heavily detailed historical drama to prove to me he was a great director. This film did pretty much convince the rest of the movie-going world, though. We all know the story of this great luxury liner sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean on that chilly April evening in 1912. The substantial loss of life still ranks among the great human tragedies of recent history (9/11, Pearl Harbor, etc). Cameron spared no cost of either time or money to make the ship and its furnishings look exactly as they would have on that maiden voyage. In terms of technical detail, this film is without peer.
The cast is generally appealing. Leo DiCaprio is far from a world-class actor, but his enthusiastic and earnest portrayal of Jack Dawson couldn't have been done better. Kate Winslet looks right in her element as a pampered young debutant trying to brake away from her boring life consisting of endless dinners and tea parties. Kathy Bates as ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" is always likeable and the rest of the cast (mostly Brits) does a good job of filling out their respective roles of cast and crew. Billy Zane gives the film's best performance as Winslet's greedy, snobbish fiancee. He is one of our most underrated actors. And you have to love David Warner as his bodyguard/enforcer.   As far as the special effects go, it's hard to imagine the sinking of the ship could have been filmed any better. Each time you view it, you seem to get a different perspective of just how lucky any of those passengers were to survive not only the actual sinking, but waiting around in life boats for help to arrive. As of this writing, only three known survivors are still alive. One can only imagine how many countless hours it took to conceive of, shoot, and edit the last hour of the film. The results are terrific.There are flaws in the overall mix, however. Some of the dialogue (Mostly Leo's) is down right corny. ""When you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose!"" or ""You seem like kind of an indoor girl"" are two examples. Also, the notion that a guy from steerage class could go up and mingle with the first class passengers under any circumstances is not plausable. Keep in mind that a first class ticket on Titanic in today's economy would go for $80,000! These were some RICH people, and they wouldn't have let a guy like Dawson near them.Anyone who watches this film will have to endure numerous scenes of sappy romance. This film is a romance above all else. Just tough it out if it bothers you. It's not that bad.This film is tragic, exciting, sensual, pretentious, corny, extravagant, and even a little cheesy. And I love EVERY DAMN MINUTE OF IT!!!!!!!!5 of 5 stars.So sayeth the Hound.",10
29,"I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are STILL talking about this movie! Obviously this movie wasn't THAT bad or else people wouldn't even BOTHER to talk about it.  I personally enjoyed this film immensly, and still do!  I guess this film isn't for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many. As for those that think that this film is ""overrated"" or ""over-hyped""...well, we only have the movie-going public to thank for that! lol*  You see, it's not CRITICS/article writers that make a film ""HUGE"" or a ""HIT"" with the general movie-going public.  PEOPLE make the film a huge success.  With Titanic, everyone was in awe.  Let's face it, a film like this had never been made before.  At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched!  Give this movie a break you guys!  The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time!  When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH (which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you) that this was a good/decent/movie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more!  So, I really wouldn't say that this movie was ""overhyped""...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being ""overhyped"".  ha!  Critics didn't even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film.  However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more!  Personally, I LOVE this film.  However, this film might not be for everyone. DOn't say that this film sucks just because of romance though!  THat is the most sexist thing I've ever heard! Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it!  The story was sweet.  The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it...the REAL star of the movie wasn't Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship!    I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job.  It's not thier best work (I've seen much BETTER work from both of them) but it wasn't the WORST I've seen on screen before. Give them a break!",10
30,"I see little point in being the two thousandth six hundred and nineteenth person in reviewing this movie but why not? I saw this movie on its release, being a ten year old child I was more concerned about seeing a young naked female than watching fifteen thousand five hundred and three people die.Such a movie was shut away in the back of my small silly mind and revived on the odd occasion through out my life. Over all I presumed this movie had little to no impact on my life until I realized it inspired my artistic talent.That mysterious picture of Rose was set in my mind from a very young age and inspires me to this day along with the other pictures in Jacks portfolio. Anyone with an artistic flare would know what I am talking about.Later on in life I presumed this movie was a propaganda piece and took less care to even notice it. Until I took notice.
It became evident that this movie portrayed two peoples exceptionally well, the rich and the poor.
That was the division and a sad one at that.
Its easy to focus on the love life of Jack and Rose but easier to focus on the indignation of the rich and poor and I think the movie might of underplayed that.
Which is acceptable.Its easy to say the movie was a tragic one but its easier to say it represents a heart of darkness and it is that darkness that makes one cry.
Its extremely well filmed. The filmography is brilliant, the music enumerates and over all the entire film compliments itself each second.There was a dispensation in film making of peak performances, this era seemed to last less than twenty years, this film was filmed during it,",10
31,"Titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. James Cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. It is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. From the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by Celine Dion. Not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the Titanic but a great love story. Romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and Titanic showcased this. Worthy of all its Oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. It is loved universally and it is truly timeless.",10
32,"A big boat hits a huge lump of ice and slowly sinks. Meanwhile, a chirpy American lad, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), gets it on with Rose (Kate Winslet), a posh bit of British totty, much to the annoyance of the girl's fiancé, Cal (Billy Zane, putting in a wonderfully loathsome performance).James Cameron's Titanic is what I call 'factasy'. In other words, it's a factual story combined with fantastical elements to make the finished article more entertaining to the masses. A more recent example of this melding of truth and fiction is The Aeronauts, but where that film played it too fast and loose with the facts and ultimately came crashing down to earth in tatters, Cameron gets the balance of real and imagined just right, making his film both a fascinating insight into one of the most famous disasters of the 20th century, and a thoroughly charming love story.A master storyteller, Cameron successfully steers his way around any potentially disastrous obstacles that threaten to bring the film to a standstill. Even though there's a good hour and a half before any sight of an iceberg, Titanic is thoroughly engrossing from start to finish, a testament to its director's skill at weaving a good yarn, and to the talent of his impressive cast (which includes Kathy Bates as Molly Brown and David Warner as Spicer Lovejoy). Kate and Leo make for one of cinema's most iconic pair of lovers, and exude a likability and charm that carries the first half of the film. The latter part is mostly about the special effects, something that Cameron excels at, always pushing the boundaries of technology. Even after 23 years, the sinking of the mighty ship is a sight to behold, and still sends chills up the spine.It's only the film's closing moments that prevent me from giving the film full marks: why oh why did Old Rose (Gloria Stuart) chuck her priceless necklace into the sea? Give it to your granddaughter, donate it to an orphanage, put it in a museum, let Bill Paxton have it, but please don't throw it overboard! And as if that crazy act wasn't reprehensible enough, when the old dear carks it, her spirit returns to the Titanic to be reunited with Jack -- excuse me Rose, but what about your dead husband and father to your child?9/10.",9
33,No spoilers! - Titanicdefinitely one of my favourite films ever. Its so beautifully made and i love it so much!Would recommend and would watch again!,10
34,It's 2019 and I still watch this movie sometimes and I am pretty sure that people are gonna keep watching this movie for the next 50 years and while watching this they will still feel that same emotion that they felt when they watched this movie for the first time. This movie still in the top 3 of the list of highest grossing movies of all time even after 22 years.,10
35,"Titanic is a movie I've seen countless times since I was a little kid and it came out. This movie is one that seems to polarize people to extremes. Some love it and will call it one of the best movies they've seen and others will hate it and label it one of the worst. As far as where I stand on it today, I still believe it is a very good film that benefits from marvelous special effects. Jack wins his way onto the Titanic in a poker game and runs into first class rich girl, Rose, when she is hanging off the end of the ship, apparently about to commit suicide. Jack saves her and they start spending a lot of time together, which really pisses off Rose's rich, but unpleasant fiancé, Cal Hockley. The story is told by the 102 year old Rose, as treasure seeker Brock Lovett searches for a diamond that was given to Rose by Cal on the boat. The movie has its share of problems. The dialogue, at times, can be corny, as can the actions. The acting, while serviceable most of the time, has some terrible moments, especially from Billy Zane and Bill Paxton. Also, the film suffers slightly from its long run time. It's not something that bothers me a great deal, but had the film been cut by something like 20 or 30 minutes, it would have flowed a lot better. Titanic isn't James Cameron's best film, but it is a majestic and epic one. I like Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose, and I also really liked Kathy Bates as a first class passenger that has just come into her money. This isn't one of the best films ever, but it's, at times, fun, sad, infuriating, and joyful. There's an emotional roller-coaster going on here.",10
36,"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are young lovers on the doomed ""Titanic"" in this 1997 film directed, written, and edited by James Cameron. The film also stars Billy Zane, Gloria Stuart, Kathy Bates, Francis Fisher, and Victor Garber.Rather than go into the story, I'll just say that this film is a true masterpiece, meticulously researched, designed, costumed, and acted, and gives one the feeling of the desperation, fear, sorrow, and finality that the people on the ship must have felt. The entire time I watched it, I kept thinking of the people on the planes and in the World Trade Center on 9/11.There have been several films about the Titanic but none so lovingly recreated and so powerful emotionally. Kate Winslet is exquisite as Rose, the upper class young woman engaged to a brute (Zane), who falls in love with third class passenger Jack Dawson (DiCaprio). DiCaprio is terrific - exuberant, passionate, and adventurous.If you don't know a lot about the Titanic, this movie will pique your interest. When you read more about it, you'll be impressed by Cameron's commitment to bring this piece of history to life.",10
37,"There is no doubt that James Cameron is capable of putting out fantastic cinema. The man just seems to have a feel for what will pull on the emotions and his eye for scene setting has no equal. Some spoilers ahead.I recently re-watched this on video, on a small TV, and it still blew me away. Action fans will, of course, be disappointed. Perhaps this even qualifies as a chick-flick. I don't know, and don't care. It's just a great movie and never drags even at over three hours.I've tried hard to find niggles, to be impartial, but the only things I can point to are a couple of instances where the special effects were bad (at the beginning, where the bow of the sunken Titanic looks exactly like what it is....a model) and later where Jack and Rose are on the the foredeck and the camera is looking back toward the superstructure (where the scenery looks like the backdrop from a school play). Other than these, the story and effects are fantastic and enhance the film rather than overpowering it.I always cry at the end, with the old lady's scenes of returning to the ship. This is one of a very few movies that do make me cry. For that reason it will always be a favourite.",10
38,"Who says that old fashioned romantic films don't sell. They certainly do if they're done right as the story in Titanic certainly is.This blockbuster version of the most famous shipwreck in history is a homage to Maytime. In fact in casting Gloria Stuart as old Rose through whose eyes we see the disaster unfold, Director James Cameron went back to a contemporary of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy.The film begins with the discovery of the wreck of the Titanic in the middle Eighties which did cause great excitement at the time. Searching the wreck divers come upon a safe and a nude portrait of a woman wearing a necklace with a diamond thought to be lost and the portrait is dated April 14, 1912. The woman is still alive and its Gloria Stuart who tells her tale the way an aged Jeanette MacDonald did in Maytime.Winning a card game that got him a third class passage aboard the maiden voyage of Titanic, itinerant artist Leonardo DiCaprio gets on board the vessel. He meets and woos a younger version of Gloria Stuart who is played by Kate Winslet. Unfortunately she's about to enter a loveless marriage for money urged on by her mother, Frances Fisher, who wants her declining years not be spent in the poorhouse. Her prospective fiancé is Billy Zane a rather arrogant young robber baron heir of his time who has a factotum/bodyguard in David Warner who has one of the best roles in the film. Still Leo and Kate get a few stolen hours of romance before the disaster strikes.One thing that James Cameron did is that he never allowed the spectacle of the disaster nor even the issues of wealth and class that were omnipresent in the Titanic story to overwhelm his romantic leads. In fact they are an integral part of the story as young Leo reaches for what was unobtainable.Leonardo DiCaprio remarked that his part of Jack was the least complex role he ever did. The part is a romantic lead, the guy has no secrets or hidden issues, he's just a young man in love. Maybe that was the reason he was not nominated for Best Actor in the face of all those nominations Titanic did get. It won for Best Picture and Best Director and a flock of Oscars in the technical area. Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart were nominated and lost for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively.Titanic is a story that's been filmed since the silent days almost in the wake of the disaster itself. The Germans made a propaganda film of it in 1943 which Nazi inspired though it was, did make a few points against the British upper classes and that the first class got saved and those in steerage mostly drowned. There was a fine version in 1953 with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck as an older married couple with problems on the doomed ship. And the British did the classic, A Night to Remember which is a documentary like recreation from the ship's officers point of view.Still they'll have to go some beat this one. Titanic is a film for lovers of all ages and run Maytime back to back with Titanic if you can get DVDs and/or VHSs of both films.",10
39,"Well, it's not ""Avatar"" levels of disappointment, but ""Titanic"" is far from Cameron's best work. Don't get me wrong, there's a great disaster epic here, but you've gotta work for it. The actual iceberg doesn't appear until 100 minutes in. A hundred. That's a lot of forced love story to slog through before real dread starts to build. And the less said about that song, the better.This isn't a bad movie, and it's technically proficient when the effects take center stage. When it's actually about White Star Line's monumental hubris, and the destruction raining down (or washing in) the spectacle lives up to the director's name. But the rest of it . . . 5/10",5
40,"Spoilers herein.I admit to a certain admiration of Cameron. Alone among special effects manipulators, he has a solid sense of what works cinematically. When he invests, he invests in a world. That world envelops us with its completeness and magnitude. It is the opposite of, say, Carpenter, who invests in the stage, in the world of the performer rather than the viewer.As far back as `Aliens' this talent has been apparent. This time, he sticks to the formula of a simple story annotated by all sorts of associations. No second plotline. No ambiguities or any questions open for viewer judgment. But he is sensitive to this I think and that is why he chose the most promising young actors that know something about narrative folding. That's where you act both in the space of the story and the world of the viewer. Kate in `Creatures' and Leo in `Romeo' did this. Kate has since grown to master it. His intent is underscored by making the color of her hair more brilliant. I don't know why yet, but this seems to signal such acting, at least in women.But alas, except for the brief scene where Leo draws her - a natural situation for this type of acting - it is absent. Probably Cameron intended something deeper and more nuanced but just couldn't manage it. In this case as well as that of the ship, the vast machine wins.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",
41,"I am very lucky Person bcz I watched This Masterpiece ...I have No Words To describe This movie...
Story -Mindblowing
Direction - Awesome
Screenplay - The Heart of the film
Performances - World class",9
42,"Technically this can hardly be faulted. As a spectacle...its very good. For a three hours plus movie it moves along ..OK. There are however, major problems with Titanic. (its NOT un-sinkable !!) The two leads Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio cant sustain a hot romance throughout the entire movie...indeed the chemistry is never quite right between the two.(Di Caprio in particular is ""out of his depth"" here) Both actors (even apart from the relationship problem) are not at their best. Perhaps the gigantic nature of the project ""got to them"".The supporting cast play this...like they are on a ship that will hit a huge ice berg. The dialogue is another problem. It lacks any feeling or spontaneity, and some of the language sounds too modern. The hype surrounding this movie before release was incredible (garaunteeing a successful picture) If your happy with technology and amazing special effects...this is your movie. But don't look too close....there are cracks here....",4
43,"Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic.  The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however.  Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal (Billy Zane). Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game.  If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries.  The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred.  One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search.  She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic.  With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding.  After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York. Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson. Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned.  Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the Titanic's legs out to full speed.  The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.  On April 15, 1912 at 11:39, an iceberg was sighted.  They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.  The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate.  The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2:18 when the lights finally failed.  The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanic's many pleas for help.  The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.  The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.  Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too. The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.  Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.  Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship.  The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Rose's mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time.  Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanic's officers were real.  The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smith's last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards.  He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaire's Captain when the Titanic sunk.  The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.  He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer's former Canadian hometown. As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-English speaking nations.  In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted.  The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss'.  Not wanting to leave her husband's side Mrs. Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic.  Furthermore, Mr. Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best.  The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat. In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water.  Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke.  All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware. The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs.  The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re-creation of the Post-Victorian era of 1912.  The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the women's suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet.  Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do.  The rich did not take well to `new money' such as Molly Brown as depicted.  Everything of the time was very formal.  Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes. Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie.  Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes. Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society. Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent cross-referencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken.  The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise.  The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people's lives.  Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night.  In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic.  Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored.  This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed.  However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed.  There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed.  As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.
Technically the film is very well done.  To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie.  In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean.  Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship.  Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage.  This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner.  At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic.  Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture. Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing.  If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900's and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you.",9
44,Titanic was such a wonderful movie!!! It accurately portrayed how the ship sunk to begin with. The storyline behind it all including the CAST!!! A+++ Film,10
45,"James Cameron's masterpiece, Titanic, is incontrovertibly the greatest anecdotal tale ever to grace the film industry. This movie has to be Cameron's masterpiece that has never been rivalled in its grandeur. This movie has a phenomenon ability to connect the audience on an emotional level, taking them on an emotional rollercoaster as the characters form bonds and face adversity from all flanks of life. This story juxtaposes the idea of love and power in different shades and angles. Leo and Kate have a relationship that is based on human emotions and desires for bonding, while Zane challenges that connection of human connection by flaunting his wealth and attempting to allure Kate with his affluence. This creates tension between the characters, and the story is very effective at controlling the crescendo so that the audience has an opportunity to connect emotionally with the characters that face this adversity. With Zane always prowling about throughout the movie, trying to win over Kate's heart with his money, there seems to always be a sombre feeling looming in the background as the events unfold between the main characters. This ominous sense of dread that is always suspended in the atmosphere seems to tie in well with the fact that the entire Titanic, the biggest commercial ship in the world, is also portend to face an unknown tragedy in the future. The director effectively seems to symbolize that human love between Kate and Leo as the impervious Titanic ship itself, and reveals the vulnerable side of it. This poetic depiction is demonstrated with so much gusto and romance, that one cannot help but fall in love as the inevitable tragedy dismantles that colossal giant known as love present in all human beings.",10
46,"It's no wonder this was so seismically successful; it really has something for everyone: a sweet tragic love story, action and suspense and for history buffs a meticulous reenactment of the most infamous sea disaster of all time. Really a stunning achievement.",10
47,"My favorite film of all time. When I was 12 years old, I watched Titanic for the first time and I felt so moved after this resonating cinematic experience. Everything about this film is timeless. From the acting, set design, costumes, cinematography, editing, music, and themes of love, loss sacrifice, and social class politics of the 20th century... this film will always have a special place in my heart. A notable mention is I consider Leo and Kate to be one of the best film couples of all time, and their chemistry is unmatched.Titanic is an iconic, classic film that I recommend for old, current, and future generations of film watchers.",10
48,I just want to say wether fictional or not this movie is a masterpice and how it have only 7.8 rantings.,10
49,"James Cameron's Titanic was nothing short of a phenomenon. Like so many others, I went to the pictures more than once to catch the must-see film of 1997. When I first saw Titanic, I was swept away by the whole film. I thought it was a thrilling piece of entertainment. Funny, resonant and exciting in equal measure.But again, like so many others I also feel Titanic has lost a bit of its sparkle over the years. Its times like this you ask yourself why a film you once held in such high regard now ranks so low? Lets see if I can answer that question.There's no denying that on the one hand its an impressive piece of filmmaking. Cameron's direction is slick and economical, something that's served him well since his extraordinary debut with The Terminator. The 3 hour running time zips by without one barely noticing. But somewhere along the way, Cameron fumbles it, and like the Titanic, the film goes down with all hands.Cameron is a self-professed Titanic enthusiast, and he's clearly put a great deal of thought, care and precision into recreating the Titanic, from the jumbo sized pistons in the engine room right down to the tiny portholes on the bow. And he exactingly crafts its destruction, first explained to us through a step-by-step computer simulation.The collision with the iceberg. The gradual flooding of the compartments. Loss of power. The ship splits in half. The eventual sinking. And then we finally see it enacted in the last 90 minutes. It would be churlish not to mention how eerily precise Cameron gets the details of the Titanic.Its a shame the human characters aren't as well developed. Cameron's clout in the industry has allowed him to array a truly extraordinary cast. But save one or two, quite a few characters are little more than cardboard cutouts.Kate Winslet shines as Rose. She does quite well and invests a great deal of resourcefulness and spunk into the part of a débutante forced into marriage. Cameron draws a lot of strength and vitality from her character.As for Leonardo DiCaprio, he brings plenty of enthusiasm to Jack Dawson, a penniless artist from steerage. But his romance with Rose never truly convinces. The relationship only works on simplistic terms by pushing all the right emotional buttons. Exactly why it struck such a chord with audiences. Especially the female members. I remember hearing quite a few ladies in the audience reach for their tissues during Jack's rather maudlin death scene.I couldn't go into detail describing how many people there are to keep track of. Otherwise I'd run out of words. The ones that scored favourably with me are Kathy Bates as the unsinkable Molly Brown, Victor Garber as Mr Andrews the ship builder, and in a small but memorable role Jason Barry as Tommy, an Irishman in steerage who meets a tragic end.As for everyone else, they're all one-dimensional. Billy Zane is cast as Rose's fiancée Cal, a snobbish, controlling tyrant. There's no depth to his character. David Warner is wasted in a thankless role as Zane's ghoulish valet, and Frances Fisher takes the prize of worst offender for playing Ruth, Rose's heartless mother.Cameron waits quite a bit before the actual collision. So you'd be forgiven for feeling more than a little restless for the first hour and a half. There are a few moments that stand out. I quite liked the way the film contrasts the differences in 1st and 3rd class, each having dinner in their own way. And you will definitely sit up and pay attention to Jack drawing Rose in the nude wearing nothing but a priceless diamond.But its really after the crash that the film finally starts getting interesting. This is the part of the story Cameron wanted to tell. He stages the destruction of Titanic with breathtaking regard. Corridors flood with cascades of water. The enormity of the hull pivoting into the air is a terrifying sight. Its in these scenes where the film holds a captive audience. Cameron shoots them with a fanatical immediacy, and watching the destruction of these stylised and impeccably crafted sets is awesome to behold.Yet even in these scenes Cameron miscues it a little. The sinking of the Titanic has been filmed many times (A Night To Remember had to have influenced Cameron). But this is the first to add comedy into the mix. I didn't mind so much in the first half because the people aboard didn't know the maiden voyage of Titanic was doomed. But in the second half, when Cameron tries to make you laugh, its an approach at odds with the dramatic thrust of the story, e.g. the aristocrats aboard want brandies while the ship is sinking. This is hardly believable behaviour, and even disrespects the memories of those aboard. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth.Cameron does demonstrate far too much of a willingness to guess what the people aboard were like. Painting them in unfavourable colours, portraying the officers as officious bureaucrats, and even having one of them shooting passengers even when there is no evidence to support that.The final scenes for Jack and Rose go on too long in my opinion. His final words, which are really hackneyed and mawkish belong more in a soap opera, not a multi-million dollar feature film. The image of a floating necropolis is striking though.Titanic is certainly an oddity. Its a film that people embraced as a whole the world over, and now they go out they're way to find fault with it. I didn't go looking for faults. They surfaced as time went by because it just doesn't hold up too well to repeated viewings. I still think you should see Titanic, even if in a few years it probably won't do for you what it used to.",5
50,"When you talk about 1990's pop culture, it's really hard to not mention, the biggest blockbuster from that decade, Oscar Winner, Best Picture of 1997's Titanic. Directed, written, by James Cameron, the movie had everything that people wish to see in a movie, making it one of the biggest money makers of all time. The movie had plenty of action, history, romantic, and music to get everybody onboard. The movie gives a fictionalized account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic in April 14, 1912. It tells the story of two members of different social classes, high socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) and working class, Jack Dawson (Leonardo Dicaprio) falling in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. The movie was so popular, that a 3D version of the film was released on April 4, 2012 to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earning it more money. The 3D version was pretty good. Titanic spun a number of other successful things such as; musicals, soundtrack, hundreds of different types of merchandise, books about the Titanic, a video game about Titanic and countless rip-offs movies. I think a good reason why a lot of people went to see this movie is how simple the story is. Yes, it's a bit predictable and pretty recycled from old Hollywood style that previous Titanic type movies had, such as 1958's A Night to Remember & 1953's Titanic. You can really see it, if you look close enough. It's full of familiar tropes and clichés. Still, the movie concept really got update to epic scale with the expensive budget, well use, in the films visual, special effects, costume, sets, and other sides of the production. James Cameron really made the movie felt like it overlap a lot of genres. It was great historical romantic action movie with many subplots like a treasure finding mystery suspense, a horror lifetime movie melodrama about female abuse, a social commentary film about classism and social Darwinism, etc. etc. Indeed, the movie is mostly label as a love movie, and this is where some people might be turn off. People do love story, when there is something in stake. By putting their lives in stake, people want to see them overcome the dangers. People also love movie if the two actors playing a couple really do show on chemistry on film. Both Leo & Kate did well in their roles showing their charm, but their characters don't have much depth to them. We really don't see, much faults in them. Their characters are very simplistic people. Also, some of their dialogue made the love story seem unrealistic or too silly to be taken serious of. Some people might hate the song by Celine Dion, 'Heart will go on' but in my opinion, the song works so well. I do think, it does get a little bit overplayed. I also have to give mad props to James Horner's score. All of the music in the film does give the movie, its great epic romantic tone and later, it's intense edge. I had lots of fun, watching the Titanic lower class party. The music there, really fit the scene. The movie also has great cinematography, as it was all eye candy to me. You can't help going in front of any ship bow, and not think of that scene from this movie. Indeed, you're feel like you're flying. For a PG-13 movie, I was deeply surprise how erotic, it was. I was just a little kid, when it first came out, the movie was the first time; I noticed that women had pubic hair. I found the sex scenes and the nudity to be tasteful. Still, the whole love affair, really does undermine, the time wasted that could cover the real victims of the Titanic sinking, more. While the actors playing supporting historical characters were all great in their roles. They were also all one-dimensional props. I still felt emotional to them, when 'Nearer, My God, to Thee,' to the tune of Bethany was playing. It was hard not to feel something about the film. Another thing people might hate is the pacing. The movie is really long and seem slow at times. The movie is also a bit historical inaccurate, but the movie went into great details to make the movie seem like the Titanic, you see here is the real Titanic. Buy the DVD as there are a lot of great special features like delete scenes, commentary, and behind the screens. The 2012 DVD version also clean up some of the big mistakes. It felt like the special edition that wasn't destroy the original work. If you happen to find it on TV, just note that it will be cut down, and censor a bit. It's nearly unwatchable. Overall: Sink or swim. Is the movie, the best Titanic movie ever? So-far, yes. Is it the worst? So-Far-no. It was safe exceptionalism type of movie. I wouldn't say, it's the smartest movie, but I would say, its lack of complexity doesn't make it not watchable. From the opening shot to the bittersweet ending, it was just amazing to watch. This movie like the actual event will always be remember on.",8
51,"It really physically hurts me when i don't see it in top 250 in IMDb's list.I am from India where the general perception of Hollywood movies are that they are more action oriented big budget entertaining films.We consider our films to be more emotional and poignant.However this movie is the most heart touching story i have ever seen on screen.I could see people's faces with tears rolling down after departing from the cinema hall.I could hear my father saying "" Never knew that these people could make such heart warming movies"".Maybe i am going a bit too far.But this is my way of paying tribute to the greatest movie ever made.",10
52,"This was an epic movie in every sense of the word. You knew the boat was going to sink, and the movie showed more than that. It showed a human love story amidst it, the lady in it struggling with her jerk of a fiance, good characters, the many historical passengers of the ship (John Jacob Astor, ""the unsinkable"" Molly Brown, etc.), a great cast, and lovely scenery. The sinking scene didn't just show the ship sink in a one-minute scene-it played on for an unforgettable length as panic ensued, Leonardo and Kate rushed through the ship as freezing seawater flooded it and the walls and windows crashed, the band played, people raced for the limited lifeboats, and the boat lifted up and broke in two before finally sinking. The was great moviemaking. Although one question:did Kate kill Leo at the end? She could have helped him up!*** 1/2 out of ****",9
53,"It's the first movie I've watched in cinema. On the first seat. It was amazing.
It seemed like the ship was going inside me :)",10
54,"It's sometimes difficult to assess a movie that was such a phenomenon in its day. Titanic was a gigantic hit upon release, talked about everywhere, unavoidable. In parallel to its massive popularity there was also a backlash of people denouncing it as clichéd and overly sentimental, a lot of whom were probably deliberately disliking it because of its ubiquity. Now, it's of that awkward age where it's too recent to merit classic status, but too distant to still really be talked about much. As such its standing in posterity seems to be undecided, as yet.Historical romantic epics like this have long been around, and have long done well at box offices and awards ceremonies. And yes, they may be formulaic, but there is a certain craft in ticking all the boxes. Titanic works by bringing us in, with those opening scenes, with the position of a clinical observer of the wreck, as we might have seen it in books or documentaries. The framing narrative has a modern familiarity that we can relate to. We are then gradually eased back into the past, and the story of the ship and those who sailed aboard her becomes humanized. And I'm not just referring to the central love story. In writing his screenplay, James Cameron goes to lengths to pick hundreds of tiny strands, from the real fates of historical personages to brief flashes of unnamed figures. This broad, human retelling of a great disaster gives Titanic a wonderful richness, not to mention a deeper poignancy.Cameron was at this point best-known for his blockbusting actioners like Aliens and the Terminator movies, so as a director he might have seemed out of his depth on Titanic. But Cameron was always a professional, never a show-off, and he could handle weighty subjects with maturity. He doesn't faff about with the camera, usually keeping it still while all the movement is within the frame. And of course, when the movie turns more action-orientated during the ship's sinking, his experience puts him in good stead. The collision with the iceberg is so suspenseful that, every time I see it, I still hope the ship will turn in time. Throughout the movie there are a lot of point-of-view shots, more than most filmmakers dare to use these days, but the idea is to bring us close to the sensation of being there. But perhaps Cameron's greatest strength is his finding of an apt image to tell a story in an instant, from a man with his family frantically thumbing through a translation book to find his way off the ship, to Ismay's guilty face against the side of the ship as he is lowered down.The studio took a gamble in allowing Cameron to cast two lead players who were as young and inexperienced as Winslet and DiCaprio, but it paid off. Winslet is not a traditional beauty, but she has a vivacious personality that makes her attractive and instantly likable. At first glance DiCaprio seems to have been hired for his looks, but he proves to have a deep sincerity, such as the when he confronts Winslet and confesses his feelings towards her. And after all it's moments like this where a performance counts the most. But what really makes these two work is their believable youthfulness, and that eager rapport between them. Passionate love stories that take place over a day or two can easily seem a bit false, but Winslet and DiCaprio seem so great together the briefness of their affair is irrelevant.This diamond of a movie is not, I'll admit, without a few flaws. Despite the brilliant construction of the screenplay, the dialogue is woefully trite. The special effects are typically over-ambitious '90s CGI, with texture-less surfaces and too many fake people (although to be fair it still looks better than, say, a scale-model would). But whereas these problems would stick out like sore thumbs in a lesser picture, Titanic has such a grand sweep and emotional power that they become insignificant. I hope cinematic history will judge Titanic well, because regardless of hype and counter-hype, it really is everything a movie should be.",10
55,"Titanic (1997) **** (out of 4) James Cameron's Oscar-winning love story about star crossed lovers (Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet) who come from different back grounds but fall in love aboard the Titanic. I remember seeing this on its opening weekend and it's amazing to see how well the film holds up after all these years. Yes, since it became so popular there are always going to be those who hold that against the film and while it's far from a masterpiece I do think it holds up quite nicely against many of the classic epics that have been made since D.W. Griffith's THE BIRTH OF A NATION. That film, GONE WITH THE WIND, BEN HUR and other epics were all grand on scale, told big stories with big effects and each of them had flaws here and there.The most amazing thing about TITANIC is the way Cameron is able to tell the fake story and mix it in with so many real-life people and events. Since 1997 I've watched countless documentaries on the real subject and watching the film on its re-release made me appreciate it so much more. The little details given about certain real-life people was a major plus and so were the smaller touches. The amount of love and detail that Cameron puts into every single shot of the movie makes it very poetic and at any time you can't help but just look around and try to take in everything in the frame. Very few films have gone all-in with their subject matters but this here goes for everything and just comes up short at a few times. It certainly helps that you have two strong leads turning in fine performance.Winslet was clearly the best of the bunch as she brings so much life to her character and perfectly manages to fit every side of her. Be it the rich, spoiled girl, the confused one, the heroic side or the love story aspect. I was less than thrilled with DiCaprio when I first saw the movie but looking back on the movie he too really stands out and delivers. Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bill Paxton and Gloria Stuart also deliver.I think the biggest flaws in the film can be had in the screenplay. Many people objected to having the fake characters so close to the real ones during the finale but this here didn't bother me too much as when we see the real people it's in situations based on what we're led to believe happened. What bothered me in 1997 and today is that Cameron decided to make Zane the main villain over the iceberg. I really think the story starts of go overboard during the third act as Leo gets chained up and then we have more drama wrapped around the real event. There's no question that the romance made this movie such a hit but I think it could have worked with everyone had the stuff with Zane been toned down. God knows there was enough drama with the sinking to make up for Zane running around with a gun. With that said, that's about the only problem with TITANIC and those things aren't disastrous enough to ruin the movie. There's no question that the romance works, the special effects are terrific and on the whole this is just a movie that works on every level.",
56,"Imagine being the Captain of The Titanic and told by it's architect that it will sink with absolute mathematical certainty. Immediate denial sets in but the instincts are too strong. The most incredible machine ever built by human hands will lie on the bottom of the ocean floor in a matter of hours, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. The sheer horror of it reels the imagination.It took me a long time to get past the hype of the film's original release. Sometimes it's better to let all that hoopla pass and see a picture on it's own merits rather than on the recommendation of anyone and everyone. While watching, I tended to key in on the historical elements of the voyage rather than the love story. Realizing that most films like this rely on a romance to move the picture along, I'm willing enough to go along with it. To go too far in the other direction would move it toward a documentary, and there are enough of those around if that's what you're after.I was fairly impressed with the technical aspects of the picture regarding the disaster. Following Ismay's (Jonathan Hyde) analysis of how the Titanic would take on water and sink, and actually seeing it play out made for some dramatic special effects. What's almost impossible to comprehend is how the passengers on board ship might have actually reacted on that fateful night. The calamity of it is absolutely mind boggling and difficult to contemplate.I give director Cameron and the special effects folks all the credit there is for producing an epic disaster film. DiCaprio and Winslet perform capably, though I wasn't necessarily wowed by their portrayals. Even if your only motivation to see the picture is it's inclusion as one of the top grossing pictures of all time, you shouldn't be disappointed.",9
57,"Hands down one of the best romance films ever made, Titanic is an epic, action-packed historical love story that delivers in every single way. Brilliant performance by Kate Winslet, beautiful and accurate costumes, feminist undertones, heart-wrenching, and golden to its core! Titanic is one of the greatest films ever made and that's all that has to be said.",10
58,"This story follows Jack (Leonardo Dicaprio). A poor artist who wins his ticket onboard the Titanic in a card game who meets Rose (Kate Winslet). A beautiful young woman who is raised in an uppercrust society who sees her life as too predictable and in control by her pompous buffoon fiamce Cal (Billy Zane) and craves a life of somewhat uncertainty. When Rose meets Jack an unlikely romance blossoms as the Titanic embarks on it's ill fated maiden voyage.
Cameron truly put in a lot of hard work to create an absolute masterpiece here. Yes the movie has flaws but what movie doesn't? I love how he made what could of been a dreary and gloomy drag of a movie and turned it into quite an up beat story (up until Titanic strikes the ice berg). This is in my favourites. And ignites a fascination for the tragic story that is the Titanic. So sad and outrageous how mostly third class passengers died in this disaster.",10
59,The best movie. Everyone watched it on February or on Valentine's Day. And I always love this movie so much. This is a Valentine's Day movie in case you need to know.,10
60,"Greetings from Lithuania.I'm a Titanic buff. Read lots of material, watched countless documentaries about the tragedy. I'm a movie buff as well - and it gets me every time i watch this unforgettable piece of work. This is a storytelling it's at is best. Visuals are outstanding even at this time, after 16 years - Titanic is aging wonderfully. The actor, all of them, did a very strong job, and i loved the two leads. I can not understand why is there so much negative buzz about this film. They say it's to chezee. You can throw a rock in me if you haven't saw more chezee stuff years after (Twilight and all the dancing shxx ""movies"" comes in to a mind first). Well i guess lots of people will always hate what is popular and at the same time really good - and that's a rare combination. Movies like this aren't made every day to say the least, and it's shame that so many people trashes them. Well, you can always just ignore them. Titanic is outstanding motion picture in every possible way, and it got what it deserved - 11 Oscars, 1,6 milliard at the box office and hardly nforgettable journey - it's hardly gets better than this.",10
61,"I saw the movie for the first time when it arrived on video, needless to say that I had very high expectations for this movie because I heard a lot about it. I watched the movie and I remembered my first reaction when I finished watching it, my reaction was: ""This is it?"" Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie, not at all. But I was disappointed about it all and it just didn't met my expectations.Everybody knows the true story about the ship the ""Titanic"" and there are many movies/series made about it already. New about this movie is the love story. It's always dangerous to put a love story in a movie because if the love story doesn't work the movie doesn't work. The love story does work for most parts in this movie, except for some scene's in which I just don't buy it.Although the movie is very long it doesn't really ever get boring, which is of course a good thing. The best part of the movie is the sinking and you can see that James Cameron is really one of the best Action directors in the business.The acting isn't great but not bad either. The special effects look good with the exception of a few needless scene's. The movie is also full of visual mistakes (for instance you can clearly see the camera in a scene, which is a HUGE mistake that I noticed on my first viewing) and the characters in my opinion aren't really interesting enough.Although the movie got more credit then it really deserved I can still recommend this movie to everybody. Good but not perfect...7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7
62,"So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred.So as much as our culture remembers Titanic for the romance, fittingly the deepest theme of this movie about so many tragic deaths is finding the will to live. In order for Rose to recapture her will to live, she needs to honestly face what's wrong in her life and cut that out. Committing to being alive means committing to living authentically as oneself.",10
63,"No sense going into great detail about this film, which just about everyone who watches movies saw when it came out. I still don't recall a film getting as much ""hype"" as this one did. I doubt if the Second Coming would get the kind of publicity this movie received. It was disgusting - the PR, the story and the favorable box office response.Oh, once the ocean-liner hits the icebergs and the disaster starts, it's terrific but that's not until the last 45 minutes of this 194-minute movie. Too bad we had to wade through all the baloney before this climactic scene.The baloney, in a nutshell, was (1) a stupid teen romance between two arrogant, unlikeable people; (2) most the film being a lie, defaming many of the people who were heroes in that disaster, instead choosing to picture them as selfish villains.The latter is all in the name of 'political correctness,' some filmmakers like James Cameron, are filled with, something akin to horse manure.To make it brief: in real life, the men in the First Class did everything they could to get the women and children safely off the boat. Just look it up! Relatives of those people were justifiably extremely upset over Cameron's totally-fabricated story, and I can't blame them.Anyway, even with all the untruths, if they had cut down on the Leonardo DiCaprio-Kate Winslet rebel-type attitude and romance, it would have been a far better film, but then again you wouldn't have the billions of dollars in revenue from the 12-15-year-old girls who flocked by the millions to see this farce. The rest of us would have preferred to see the true story of the famous disaster.",5
64,"This is just a record breaker and you can see why. Even to this day I find anything Titanic related really interesting,. Such a great movie.",10
65,"James Cameron and his team really did their research. I can see it happening just like this, love story notwithstanding. Historical fiction absolutely done right. Some of the CGI is subpar but it's a minor flaw considering the rest of the picture.",9
66,"So you flip through the cable channels on your remote. The same old music videos are running, and the reruns get tiring. Later, you find something interesting. The evening news, Entertainment Tonight, 60 Minutes, VH1, and every other network airs clips from this, the biggest money-making film in history. TITANIC emerges as a genuine Hollywood classic for the second generation of American cinema. Never since GONE WITH THE WIND has there been powerful moviemaking with heavy genius from James Cameron. It's more than just a love story. It's an all-out disaster movie with style and vigor combined with a creative instrumental music score. It even began the craze that lured us into discoveries of the gigantic ship that never proved itself when it sunk anyway.Brilliant use of photography is what stands out the best. Imagine every single little piece of detail that wouldn't fit on this message. Replicas of the engine room and the interior designs are highly crafted to maximize the full experience of being on the Titanic while sailing on crisp, clear sea water filled with dolphins swimming with grace. During the night, one can look up the starry skies while the bright lights shine. How tragic it is for a luxury liner to capsize in half, sinking miles beneath the surface, and showing off the greatest achievement in motion picture special effects! A job extremely well done! Who will match this kind of excellence in the near future?As for the players, the pair of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are now remembered as the Clark Gable & Vivian Leigh of the next generation. Both are young, of course, and they really can ACT! Winslet should have taken home the Oscar (what blasphemy of those Academy Awards judges!). Her performance as ""Rose"" is a show stealer, as she did most of the incredible acting far better than today's young actresses. From smoking a cigarette, to possessing true beauty, to posing nude, to being a heroine, and to become a survivor, this will be a role so hard to beat in Winslet's future films. DiCaprio, on the other hand, also does magnificent as a ""street boy"" and a ""troublemaker"". The second half is the most important time to discover his best talents, including the end. Both are sensational in almost every respect.Well, you can't always expect a movie to be perfect. TITANIC's shortcomings are relatively minor. The ""modernized"" scenes don't quite prove true to a historical masterpiece made with expensive sets and decorations. Mr. Jerry Garcia Lookalike should've changed his shirt, instead of wearing the one with ""Happy Face"" shot in the head. But Gloria Stuart as the old ""Ross"" makes up for the modern touch in telling and revisiting the Titanic story through her past experiences. It's also important that we already know how the disaster had become, and that the movie tells under a fictional basis.Of localized interest: Diana Morgan was once a TV news anchor for an NBC station out here. She has recently taken on an acting career playing the role of a news reporter, notably in BABYLON 5. You will hardly get to notice her on that small TV set shown at the start of the film, but you can hear her voice.Over three hours of powerful and unprecedented movie imagery. To date, it may very well be the greatest film ever made.",9
67,"Well what can I say you gotta love a good disaster movie set on real events and Titanic checks ALL the boxes for a good movie. Set in April 1916 the movie opens with an elderly woman named Rose(played by the late Gracie Stuart)who talks to the reporters(one played by Bill Paxton from Mighty Joe Young) and she talks to them along with her granddaughter about the story of the Titanic. So we cut in to see all the people being sent aboard the famous ship and we see a younger looking Rose(played by Kate Winslet who looks so different with her dyed red hair)and her boorish fiancée played by Billy Zane(from The Phantom)who is by her side as she sets sail on the ship. Meanwhile a charming man named Jack Dawson(played by the gorgeous Leonardo Di Caprio before he morphed into Eric Dane's love child now)as he and his mates are playing cards so his friend decides to abort the ship with him as he yells the famous line IM THE KING OF THE WORLD.But later in the film Jack falls in love with Rose while his staying on the ship and the two become really close with each other. But what will Rose's boorish egotistical fiancée think of it??.This film maybe 3 hrs long but its definitely worth it. The music by John Horner is brilliant there's this one scene I can recall where Jack and Rose are dancing to some Irish music and they had a lot to drink and their smiling and laughing at each other,THAT was just so well done. Also you gotta love the Celine Dion hit My Heart Will Go On.The story is brilliant in fact this is what REALLY happened on the Titanic and if you come across another movie that says Titanic: The Legend Goes On I suggest you avoid this one and watch this overrated flick instead of it as the animated version well if you seen it you know what its like.Also I loved the chemistry between Winslet & DiCaprio which was so realistic and genuine. Bottom line if you haven't seen it then check it out im telling you,that you won't regret it. I seen it a million times before and if I catch it again on TV at an earlier time than i'll watch it again.10/10",10
68,"If we have to figure out what the most precious identity humans have, that must be memory. We can absolutely remember lots of things happened during our 80-year lives. Our memories construct the great history. And Titanic is about an old woman's memory about a huge famous boat and her lover she met during her endless trip to America. The first time I watched this film was in my early age. And some precious memory of my own happened during that time. Maybe this is the most important part of the movie to myself.",10
69,"Titanic is pop culture perfection. It's everything wide audiences crave and has elite craft. Even the writing (its weakest aspect) is fair. The love story is generic, but it's efficient and accents the dramatic disaster. In some ways, that romance is just right because the setting is already complex. More nuance could've overly complicated the film. Sometimes, simplicity is not only desired by audiences, but also required by circumstances. Meanwhile, the acting is quality. Leo is fine, Winslet is great, and the supporting cast is strong. All together, this provides the ideal amount of emotional investment to synergize with Titanic's grand spectacle.Despite Titanic's sentimentality, its filmmaking is its core. Each ingredient supports a sense of grandeur that elevates the experience. The steady camerawork is constantly sweeping, emphasizing the ship's scale and heightening the action. The elaborate sound symbolically amplifies the daunting ocean and immense tragedy. The editing begins gracefully and smoothly builds energy during the chaos. The music is iconic, elegant, and fitting. The production is incredibly elaborate and detailed. The effects are dedicated, real, and versatile. Lastly, the passionate direction wholly commits to authenticity, emotion, and excitement, making Titanic a truly captivating experience. Ultimately, Titanic has it all.Writing: 7/10

70,"An absolutely spellbinding film that still holds up over 20 years later. I first saw this as a 12-year-old in 1997 and recall being utterly captivated by the story, the imagery, the characters, the score and the sheer spectacle of it all. 'Titanic' was an event, not just a film. There was nothing like it before, and there has been nothing like it since.
Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet, both relatively unknown actors at the time of the film's original release, shine as Jack and Rose, two young people from opposite ends of the social spectrum who are brought together by fate against the backdrop of one of history's greatest tragedies. Winslet steals every scene with her portrayal of a deeply unhappy woman thrust into an engagement of convenience at the behest of her domineering mother, only finding happiness and her true self when she crosses paths with di Caprio's Jack Dawson. Tragedy inevitably strikes however, and it becomes a fight for survival as the great ship Titanic founders. For all of the special effects, it is the chemistry between Winslet and di Caprio that drives the film. If you have ever become infatuated with someone in a very short space of time, then it is very easy to relate to the relationship between Jack and Rose. They perfectly capture the intensity of infatuation and the recklessness of youth. Other excellent characters include Billy Zane's charming but abrasive Cal Hockley, Frances Fisher's sneering Ruth Dewitt Bukater and Kathy Bates' bolshy Molly Brown. Finally, the great Gloria Stewart portrays 'old' Rose with such sincerity and heart that it is difficult to believe she didn't live through all of this in real life.",10
71,"I detested this movie so much when I first saw it that I really wanted to give it one star, but as bad as I still think it is, it is fairly well-made and at least the technical department earned their salaries here (though quite frankly I thought that some of the CGI effects screamed ""FAKE!"" louder than the scale models used by Roy Ward Baker in 1958's A NIGHT TO REMEMBER). What sinks this movie for me (pun very much intended) is the fictional love story forcibly inserted by Cameron, doubtless with the cynical intention of attracting teenage girls. Which it did. By the millions.When Oscar time rolled around, Hollywood apparently decided that 1997 was the year to call the movie that made the most money *Best Picture,* to say nothing of the other ten Oscars it won, plus three nominations. Now I have not seen every movie ever to win the Best Picture Oscar, but of all the ones I have seen, this one has to be the least deserving of the honor.For starters, aside from the fictional romance, there is nothing new here. I made mention above of Roy Ward Baker's 1958 film A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, which is THE definitive dramatic film about the Titanic disaster: there are no fictional characters, no romantic heroes or heroines; Baker chose to tell the story plainly, in an almost documentary fashion that still carries a huge wallop fifty-two years later.Cameron's film, by comparison, though it is wonderful to look at (obviously no expense was spared, from costumes to special effects), is a curiously cold and uninvolving piece of work except for when Leo and Kate are on the screen. Cameron's fatal mistake was that he forgot that the Titanic disaster was a real-life human drama; Roy Ward Baker knew this, and his film, fully an hour-and-a-half SHORTER than this one, yet manages to show the terrible loss of humanity of all classes that terrible night. Cameron's film has little feeling for any of the subsidiary characters, with a couple of exceptions, such as a lusty Kathy Bates, delightful as the unsinkable Molly Brown, and Gloria Stuart, who at eighty-eight came out of retirement to play Rose at age one hundred-one.Unfortunately these bright spots are too far and few between in a much- too-long movie that cannot escape the fact that the central romance is uninteresting at best, and irritating at worst. Cameron shows a shameless disregard for his actors in this film. Leonardo DiCaprio is not the least bit convincing as a young man from 1912; he comes across as a typical California brat who grew up eating Sugar Pops. Kate Winslet, a terrific actress, is horribly misused here; left to her own devices, she often fails to find the right notes, most noticeably towards the end, when she and Leo climb the ship to the near-vertical stern, and she turns to him and squeals, ""This is where we first met!"" The line is awful in and of itself, especially in the context of that moment, but had she delivered it with tears streaming down her cheeks and a great deal of pathos, it might have been palatable. Instead she sounds like a teenage girl going to a high-school dance.There are a few other good performances in the supporting cast in addition to the two I have mentioned, but unfortunately they and the rest of what was a true-life story of hubris, heroics, class divisions, and self-sacrifice, are buried under the cheap date-movie romance that Cameron inserted. I'll give him credit for one thing: he knew that the love story was what would keep the viewers coming back; had he chosen to simply tell the true story, I don't know if the film would have sunk faster than the ship did, but it most certainly would not have gotten all the undeserved acclaim that it did.If you haven't seen A NIGHT TO REMEMBER yet, get it. Compare the two and see the difference honest storytelling can make to a movie.",3
72,"It's sometimes difficult to assess a movie that was such a phenomenon in its day. Titanic was a gigantic hit upon release, talked about everywhere, unavoidable. In parallel to its massive popularity, there was also a backlash of people denouncing it as clichéd and overly sentimental, a lot of whom were probably deliberately disliking it because of its ubiquity. Now, it's of that awkward age where it's too recent to merit classic status but too distant to still really be talked about much. As such its standing in posterity seems to be undecided, as yet.Historical romantic epics like this have long been around, and have long done well at box offices and awards ceremonies. And yes, they may be formulaic, but there is a certain craft in ticking all the boxes. Titanic works by bringing us in, with those opening scenes, with the position of a clinical observer of the wreck, as we might have seen it in books or documentaries. The framing narrative has a modern familiarity that we can relate to. We are then gradually eased back into the past, and the story of the ship and those who sailed aboard her become humanized. And I'm not just referring to the central love story. In writing his screenplay, James Cameron goes to lengths to pick hundreds of tiny strands, from the real fates of historical personages to brief flashes of unnamed figures. This broad, human retelling of a great disaster gives Titanic a wonderful richness, not to mention a deeper poignancy.Cameron was at this point best-known for his blockbusting actioners like Aliens and the Terminator movies, so as a director he might have seemed out of his depth on Titanic. But Cameron was always a professional, never a show-off, and he could handle weighty subjects with maturity. He doesn't faff about with the camera, usually keeping it still while all the movement is within the frame. And of course, when the movie turns more action-orientated during the ship's sinking, his experience puts him in good stead. The collision with the iceberg is so suspenseful that, every time I see it, I still hope the ship will turn in time. Throughout the movie, there are a lot of point-of-view shots, more than most filmmakers dare to use these days, but the idea is to bring us close to the sensation of being there. But perhaps Cameron's greatest strength is his finding of an apt image to tell a story in an instant, from a man with his family frantically thumbing through a translation book to find his way off the ship, to Ismay's guilty face against the side of the ship as he is lowered down.The studio took a gamble in allowing Cameron to cast two lead players who were as young and inexperienced as Winslet and DiCaprio, but it paid off. Winslet is not a traditional beauty, but she has a vivacious personality that makes her attractive and instantly likable. At first glance, DiCaprio seems to have been hired for his looks, but he proves to have a deep sincerity, such as when he confronts Winslet and confesses his feelings towards her. And after all, it's moments like this where performance counts the most. But what makes these two work is their believable youthfulness and that eager rapport between them. Passionate love stories that take place over a day or two can easily seem a bit false, but Winslet and DiCaprio seem so great together the briefness of their affair are irrelevant.This diamond of a movie is not, I'll admit, without a few flaws. Despite the brilliant construction of the screenplay, the dialogue is woefully trite. The special effects are typically over-ambitious '90s CGI, with texture-less surfaces and too many fake people (although to be fair it still looks better than, say, a scale-model would). But whereas these problems would stick out like sore thumbs in a lesser picture, Titanic has such a grand sweep and emotional power that they become insignificant. I hope cinematic history will judge Titanic well because regardless of hype and counter-hype, it is everything a movie should be.",9
73,"There's no doubting that the titanic is an epic movie for the ages. Beautiful cinematography and acting, such chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet. The costuming and set design are beyond comparison, creating stunning visuals and bringing the story to life. The gravity of the disaster is conveyed beautifully and never ceases to make me weep endlessly. My only faults are that Jack could have definitely fit on that door, and old rose was dead wrong for tossing that necklace in the ocean.",7
74,This movie is extremely better then I expected it to be I thought it was just gonna be a stupid romantic movie with stupid characters but it's way more then that from how good James Cameron can make a female character and DiCaprio is also really good in this Jack and Rose have a really good chemistry then I was expecting and in the climax doesint hold back with a lot more shown deaths witch I wouldn't expect a lot of from James Cameron we also see when there going back to get survivors we see dead children a stuff and it's pretty disturbing I recommend this highly I had low expectations don't let the runtime scare you,10
75,"Let's get one thing straight before we embark on this perilous journey into Hollywood History: the only ""truth"" in this movie is that the RMS Titanic did sink in April 1912 and that Leonardo DiCaprio is prettier than Kate Winslet. Everything else in James Cameron's *Titanic* is marshmallow fancy.Movie opens in the modern Atlantic, with a Titanic salvage crew helmed by amiable Brock Lovett (sun-weathered Bill Paxton), who haul surfaceward some intriguing artifacts. 84-year-old Rose (Gloria Stuart) claims she was a Titanic passenger, so is brought aboard Lovett's vessel to provide information.In a cheeky foreshadowing of the breath-hammering visuals to come, Lovett's crewmate outlines Titanic's death throes, aided by computer graphics (probably the selfsame graphics that the actual movie used as storyboard for its final visuals), before Lovett asks Rose for a firsthand account of the RMS Titanic and she, in a rheumy Percodan haze, starts relating a chick flick with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.And under the chick flick, the film's main premise - a story of White Pride, sautéed in eleven million gallons of seawater.Rose's narration is the anomaly that eats at this film's verisimilitude: though we humor her spinning her tale of irrelevant romantic rhetoric, when it comes to events outside her sphere of experience (such as private meetings between the captain and crew), she relates them as if omniscient (if we are to regard all the film's action aboard Titanic as her testimony). Even the iceberg impact is comprehensively covered from all angles (from the lookouts, to the bridge, to the engine room, captain and crowd) by Rose's ""flashback."" Not bad for someone who was backseat bonking her body-shaved boy-man at the time.Rose laments that she ""doesn't even have a picture of Jack,"" her steerage-class lover (Leonardo DiCaprio). Maybe that's why she remembers him as so staggeringly beautiful.It's a pity that writer-director Cameron leaned so heavily on the vapid love story as this movie's propeller, as the rest of the film is a chest-clenching stunner.The grandeur of the Royal Mail Ship Titanic is beautifully captured in its restored filmic incarnation. Costuming, characters and exterior shots are paid the utmost detail  although it must be said that, historically at least, DiCaprio's character (Jack) was probably treading a time period more acquainted with the use of recreational drugs with his yells of ""Woooo!"" from the ship's prow. His friend, Fabrizio (Danny Nucci), didn't help with the authenticity; supplied by a casting agency specializing in Ethnic Stereotypes, Nucci is about as Italian as a Domino's Pizza, sporting the absolute worst ""Movie Italian"" accent of all time  the exact same accent my friends and I would adopt in the schoolyard when we were ""pretending to be Italian."" Winning their tickets in a card game, Jack and Fabrizio are overjoyed even in their steerage quarters Whilst above the water line, onto the first class decks desultorily rambles Rose (Kate Winslet) with her demanding mother (Frances Fisher), stormy fiancé (Billy Zane) and luggage enough to kill three pack-elephants. Elbow-gloved and triple-corseted, she remarks via voice-over, ""To me it was a slave ship, taking me back to America in chains."" Try telling that to an African-American, honey, in your big feathery hat and frothy bloomers.Meeting Jack during a spoiled brat suicide attempt, Rose is drawn to his vagabond swagger and hairless torso, falling for idiot lines like, ""You've got a fire inside you and I'd hate to see it go out."" (George Lucas wrote that one.) The film world does not communicate ""smell."" The super-privileged have a way of ""deodorizing"" themselves that is wholly alien to the super-poor. Hence, no matter how much prettier Jack is than Rose, as soon as she stood downwind of his below-decks stench, the romance would have come to an earthy halt (retching optional).Instead, Jack is invited to sup with the pinky-raisers, where he blathers about his itinerant lifestyle as if it was a blessing; living the devil-may-care bum's life of cobbling his sustenance from whatever rat-brained scheme comes along, and literally not knowing ""where he'll be sleeping the next night"" may be a romantic notion if you are a successful writer or an independently wealthy traveler  but not if you are, in fact, a REAL BUM.An ocean liner has to sink before Rose lets go of this vagrant (whilst staying in Spoiled Byoch character by selfishly hogging the one floating plank in all of the Atlantic).A well-made, mind-numbing romance this cheesy usually scores low  but Cameron gained his points purely due to his magnificent boat-tipping.The climax of *Titanic* is a startling visualization of an historic event which no one alive on earth today saw first hand. Drawing from the latest forensic knowledge, combined with the physics of the process, Cameron places us directly on deck during his nightmare vision. We see the situation mount, from berg impact and apathy, to incredulity and ultimately panic, capturing the violent and colossal majesty of the ship breaking in half and pulling its aft section downwards vertically.The death throes of the RMS Titanic are astounding in their realism; we cannot help but compare the final scenes of *A Night To Remember*, with its wholly inaccurate, romantic portrayal of the doomed passengers aboard that black-and-white Titanic singing nobly together as their ship slipped away under them at a 45 degree angle. Not only is collective humanity never that level-headed, the physics of the sinking process was entirely ignored.With humanity onboard Cameron's boat ignobly screaming and selfishly grasping and punching and shooting and falling violently onto propeller blades, with smokestacks crushing passengers, decks splintering, cables whiplashing through foaming brine, and the final cataclysmic submersion at a vertiginous ninety-degree angle, Cameron's *Titanic* is  titanic!If even for a brief, awe-inspiring moment in time, it's good to be the King of the World.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",7
76,"First; let me say that the recreation of the RMS Titanic as a computer- generated entity is extremely well realised. If ever we needed proof that CGI can add an extra dimension to established technique and 'effects' when it's done with meticulous precision - here it is.But what about story? The Titanic contained over 1,500 human stories. Most of them were to end in terror on that fatal, freezing night.However, Mr Cameron decided that non of these were worth spit. They would serve simply as a desperate backdrop for two imaginary characters who might just as easily have been computer-generated themselves, so artificial, clichéd and crass were their presentation.Star-crossed young lovers projected against conflicting circumstances of the larger world have been a staple in human drama for as long as we have kept records. Perhaps the most famous example is Shakespeare's 'Romeo & Juliet'.What have we got here? Disaffected society girl meets, and finds redemption, in gallant working-class hero. Pass me the vomitarium, someone. She already has a beau; and he's as knavish as can be. In an early silent movie you can see him with a big bristly moustache and cruel leer, tying his victim to a railroad track. He's not going to be put down by a working-class oik. He'll resort to murder, if needs be. Cameron turns this Mack Sennett cliché on its head by casting the heroine as saviour. We see her wading waist-deep in the icy Atlantic waters without flinching from the cold (just you try it!), in earnest search for her manacled hero. Love isn't just blind - it's numb.But - hey; wait a minute! this is a romantic story from the old school. We can't let emancipation stand in the way of a damp hankie. The hero's got to do what a hero's got to do. Isn't that what males are bred for, after all? I mean; equality in pay is one thing, but equality in death? I don't think so. Oh-no; the male is always the more expendable. So, in the end we see him slowly freezing to death in the ocean whilst the heroine survives on a piece of flotsam. His duty done, his grip is relinquished, and he slips down to eternity. Whilst she gets to live another day and find a more durable schmuck. You can see that same scenario at the end of equally laughable 'Starship Troopers 2'. Yep; the hat's that old.And she might have to move pretty damn quick too. That passionate little dalliance in the coach could well have put a bun in the oven. It wouldn't do to have a child out of wedlock in 1912.Romance in the face of disaster became quite a fashion at this time, with other movies like 'Pearl Habour' playing much the same card. As I say; young romantic tragedy is a long-standing cultural staple in human story-telling. It just isn't usually so extremely crass and predictable as 'Titanic'.Tissues out or vomitarium at the ready, depending upon your gullibility quotient.",3
77,"In honor of the 100 year anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic, the movie Titanic was re-released in theaters, digitally remastered and in 3-D. Having seen the movie in theaters in 1998 when it came out, and loving it ever since, I was happy to go see it again in 2012. We owned the VHS when I was growing up so I've probably seen Titanic at least a dozen times. There's nothing quite like seeing it in theaters though. It's a film of epic proportions in both budget and content, and I think seeing it on the big screen does it incredible justice. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing it there for the second time.I think many people criticize Titanic for the ""cheesy love story"". Jack and Rose are the early 1900's version of Romeo and Juliet, complete with a history that spans a mere few days, clashing backgrounds and of course Jack's death at the end of the movie. They even have some corny dialogue here and there (ex: ""I'll never let go Jack. I'll never let go.""). In spite of that however, I thoroughly enjoy their story. I feel that, unlike Romeo and Juliet, Jack and Rose's attraction to each other is genuine. She loves him because he pulls her out of her shell and shows her that there is more to life than money and social status. He loves her because she takes a chance on him despite societal expectations and loves him for who he truly is. I think it's great. Call me a romantic but I'm a sucker for their story. On a side note, it's so surreal to see Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet so young. They've certainly evolved as actors since Titanic.What James Cameron and his crew were able to do with special effects, construction and design in Titanic just floors me. Titanic is just so horrifyingly authentic. Every scream, every person crushed from a torrent of water, every piece of the ship ripped apart just looked so real to me. I think that's why I like it so much. I don't get my kicks from seeing people suffer, but there was something strangely beautiful in how that movie was shot and how the action of the ship sinking unfolds. I really felt like I was there with all those people. I really appreciated just how many different scenes there were. They made it a point to address many different parts of the ship, many different people and many different horrific ends. So sad. So beautiful. I hope that makes some sense.So now you know, I'm a sucker for Titanic. Guilty as charged.",10
78,This film goes down in history as one of the best based on a true historical event. You'll feel the pain of the characters as the ship sinks. It's truly a human tragedy,9
79,"While some viewers were disappointed that this wasn't just another A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, I believe that the use of the fictional characters was an effective story-telling device. We are brought into the story through Jack and Rose with the historical characters and events as a backdrop. The same device is used in such great films as GONE WITH THE WIND, THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE, and THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON. History is thus brought to life without being ponderous.",
80,"James Cameron's Titanic was something else. It's amazing to think how this movie came out in 1997. Titanic is a film that many will remember that broke ground. Not just for the actors involved but for filmmaking in general.Titanic is very, very well made. You can clearly tell that this was a passion project for James Cameron. He wanted to make this movie special and he has. The amount of research that Cameron had to do to make the film look realistic is evident.The entire set is a whole world in itself. Cameron's direction transports us to ins and outs of the ship which all look so beautiful. The atmosphere and grandness of the ship sticks with you especially during the inevitable sinking scene where you can feel the terror and panic aboard. The cinematography is pure brilliance. The ship has a very elegant feel and the set design and costumes from the inside also adds to that feeling. Visually, this is one the best looking films of all time.The acting was sublime all through the film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are in top form and have some of the best chemistry in a film ever. Their romance seemed so believable that I never felt bored during it. The supporting cast are also great, especially Billy Zane.I have to give immense praise to James Cameron for handling this film. He took a lot of time researching and working to make this movie the grand spectacle it is and feel as accurate as possible to the real incident. Whilst some think this film is overrated, you cannot deny the sheer effort that went into crafting this movie.",9
81,"All of the critics for ""Titanic"" should really be on line for the new Star Wars, right?The extent of critcism for ""Titanic"", even at this late date, indicates that even those who hate it are still thinking about it and want to bash in it light of the new George Lucas movie.""Titanic"" has a solid place in movie history, with movie fans everywhere in the world, and a couple of bored and angry people are not going to change that.  I love the movie and I always will.",10
82,"One of The best movies ive seen, 10/10 and People say its ok? This movie AT its best mfk.",10
83,"James Cameron's blockbuster Titanic is timeless, moving, and a real visual splendor (though they could brush up on one or two CGI scenes). The attention to detail is stunning and breathtaking. It is perfectly written and perfectly cast - particularly with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose. They both are extremely talented, top-notch actors.
You don't even notice how long it goes for. It grabs you and sucks you in. But it is also sad and a bit depressing knowing what will happen at the end. I haven't cried at a movie in a long time, so was surprised to find myself crying at this movie. I can relate in some respects to Rose and I really like the message about enjoying life.
A strongly recommended movie.",9
84,"Well, it's been a year since my last review of this film (this is review #3).  I saw ""Titanic"" on the big screen in 1997, and bought the DVD when it came out (which I still watch from time to time, maybe about twice/year).""Titanic"" still works for me as an epic spectacle and blockbuster.  The love story is OK, I don't really care... this is the movie to watch for eye candy and epic scope, not emotion.  I never did get caught up in any sobby or sentimental emotions with this film.  The overall story isn't bad... yes, some of the lines are cheesy and the dialog is corny, so what?  The low point of the film has to be DiCaprio sinking beneath the waves... not sad at all to me, but so what?""Titanic"" stands as a fabulous spectacle and a great movie watching experience.  The years have not diminished that in the least, and the special effects couldn't be done any better today than they were in 1997. The nit-pickers are still picking, 'sentimentalists' are still getting outraged at the 'realists' bashing the film, and I'm still sitting back and enjoying a couple times a year a film that was highly overrated at the Oscars (so what else is new) but where every penny of the budget shows on the screen... the spectacle of it... the scope, it can sweep you away.  Turn your brain off, turn the lights down, and enjoy on the biggest possible screen.9/10 pieces of popcorn from this 38 year old male.",9
85,"Titanic (1997)11 Academy Awards - Including Picture, Director and ScoreThe Number 1 Grossing Film Of All Time - $1,845,000,000.Titanic is a glorious achievement; this isn't a film. It's much more than a film; it's an experience. You yourself feel you are on that ship; your emotions, your mood corresponds that of the characters. James Cameron's direction is a technical triumph. The man did not only manage to put to use a $202,000,000 budget, capture never before built sets, but on top of all that he had to show us characters, feelings, stories, lives and the ultimate fate of a doomed liner. Cameron passes the test that really takes every cinematic element to the maximum. Forget all that now. When you walk into a cinema and sit down for 3 hours which only seem like 90 minutes, you will know why Titanic is the film it is. A masterpiece in every respect. Maybe not the greatest film ever made, but a nearly perfect cinematic achievement, in terms of storyline, focus and technical superiority.""Grandeur and Love collide with an inevitable destiny in James Cameron's stunning masterpiece. Titanic. Best Film of 1997 and one of the most perfect films of recent years""",8
86,"A typical James Cameron movie, i.e. all style, no substance, and excruciatingly long. Plot is basic - love story set against the Titanic tragedy, that's it. Just basically drifts for 3.25 hours around that central plot. The direction is all about the amazing special effects, another Cameron trademark.On the plus side, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are excellent in the lead roles, and their interaction is spot-on. This movie pretty much launched their careers (well, in DiCaprio's case, shifted it up several notches).",5
87,"It's bitterly ironic that the biggest blockbuster of all time is not on the IMDb's Top 250. Even stranger still, many who loved it at the time of its release have now turned on it (just ask anyone under the age of 25). This is not due to its quality, but to its hype. It goes without saying that a film this big had immense publicity at the time of its release, but what no one learned until too late is that there is too much of a good thing. People began to tire of hearing about what the stars (especially the new heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio) were doing, and they were sick of hearing gossip magazines never shutting up about ""Titanic."" The film had the odds against it: it's a romance, and that is one of the most volatile genres in terms of popularity. By the time the spoofs of the film's most famous scenes came along, ""Titanic's"" reputation was already in danger. After that, people began only to see the spoofs, and now the film's popularity has sunk to where the real ship is.I had fond memories of the film from when it was popular, so I decided to perform an experiment: even after the immense backlash the film suffered, could it still hold up? The answer is a resounding YES!""Titanic"" opens when a treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) finds a drawing of a woman wearing the diamond that he is looking for. Soon after releasing his findings, an elderly woman (Gloria Stuart) claims that it's her in the picture. So Lovett flies her out to his ship to tell her the story behind the diamondAs a young woman, she was sailing to America to live the life of a boring society lady in a loveless marriage. Planning on ending it all, she is about to jump ship when she is saved by a young man from steerage. Thus begins a classic love story that is doomed from the start by complications other than those they began with.The reason the film is so good is because the two central characters are brilliantly written and acted. Leonardo DiCaprio became an instant heartthrob to girls around the world (something he apparently hated), and it's not hard to see why. DiCaprio has everything to make the male lead of an epic romance work: he's good-looking and talented (Winslet was honored with an Oscar nomination for her performance, although it's hard to understand why DiCaprio was left out, because he equals her). Jack Dawson is an immensely likable guy. He falls hard for Rose, someone who he knows is clearly out of his league. But he's so immensely likable that we want him to win Rose's heart. His new lover, Rose, is no ordinary society girl, much as she tries. She can't stand the rigidly controlled life she's going to lead, and Jack is her escape. But while she may wear a corset, she's no damsel in distress. She's independent and tough. The romance works because Jack and Rose are meant for each other.Their supporting cast is excellent. The two most important supporting characters are Rose's fiancée, Cal Hockley, and her mother, Ruth (Frances Fisher). Cal Hockley is a vicious snob with a constant sneer on his face. He comes from a wealthy family, and will do anything to get what he wants. He demands obedience from Rose, something she will not give (to anyone, much less Cal). Her mother, Ruth, is just as snobbish and cruel, but she's also desperate. Their family was left virtually penniless, and she's trying to save face. As cruel and despicable as they are, neither one becomes a caricature. Zane and Fisher should have dually been honored with awards for their acting. Bates is especially noteworthy as the delightfully brash ""new money"" Molly Brown.""Titanic"" was the most expensive film of the 20th century, and it's clear that every penny was put to good use. ""Epic"" doesn't begin to describe this movie. It's huge in spectacle, and the sinking of the ship, which takes up the last half hour, is jaw-dropping. But that's not the only place where the effects were used. We never get a sense that we're looking at sets or CGI; from every frame of the ship, we believe that we are on the ship with the characters. Interesting note: Cameron actually went down to the wreckage and filmed footage there. But that doesn't stop there. Cameron wrote a script that allows us to view every part of the ship (and in a way that's plausible.James Cameron has long been considered a god of action movies, but this is the first time his skills were honored. Not only is Cameron a wizard with special effects, he is also a master storyteller. ""Titanic"" is a long film (as all epics are), but not one of the 3+ hours of footage is wasted. The film moves, and there is never a dull spot. He knows the speed at which a person gets involved in the story, and uses this to his advantage. But the biggest accomplishment is that he makes the romance, one of the most difficult genres to dabble in, work with immense effectiveness. The romance burns up the screen, so much that we're more concerned with Jack and Rose's fates than we are taking in the sight of the sinking ship. And the scene where Jack draws Rose's picture is potently erotic (especially for a PG-13 movie, which shows not real nudity or sex, but it is strongly implied).I realize that I am not writing this to people who haven't seen the movie (are there such people?). I am writing it to those who are now convinced that this is a sappy and painfully bad film. I assure you: it's as good as it was the first time you saw it.",10
88,"It's a masterpiece and one of the best movies ever made. Period.
I pity those who haven't watched it yet or didn't like it.",10
89,"I'm rewatching this now. It has held up very well after all these years. I saw this in the theaters when I was 22. It was just me and my boyfriend who I recently just started seeing. We are no longer together, but I still remember him saying that the way the two were holding each others hands at the bow of the boat, reminded him of the way we touched each other's hands at the time. We were in love, just as Rose and Jack were. This movie also touched home because I too came from money and thought most of the rich people I knew and had dated were uptight and didn't seem to let loose enough and have fun....and I was afraid too I would fall in a trap to it and live a boring existence. It gave me more strength to branch out and not search for someone to love just because of their wealth and status in the world, but instead find love for whats inside a person. My world is better now because of that decision. So I thank you Titanic!",10
90,"I've always enjoyed the British version, ""A Night to Remember,"" based on Walter Lord's popular book. Yes, it's black and white, and a bit dated, but it's a straightforward telling of an awesome disaster.The 1953 Hollywood version was a boring soap opera which was set aboard the Titanic simply so that some exciting and dramatic scenes could be tacked on at the end.This one is more like the Hollywood version, only with a budget extended to the power of n. What a wreck! In some shots the ship doesn't seem the size of a man-made artifact at all. It seems impossibly huge, twenty leagues long. When the stern rises into the air and a figure falls from the fantail, the figure dwindles down toward the sea which seems a million miles away, and vanishes except for a minuscule white spot marking its splash point. The Titanic in this movie is colossal, stupendous, magnificent, gargantuan, or -- in a word -- titanic.Before the f/x-resplendent climax we endure a romance between a lower-class handsome young man and a pretty, rich young lady. Now, few people realize this, but this is the first cinematic exploration of the theme of True Love overcoming Class Distinctions. Yes, it's true. Love conquers all and you can be sure that threepence or so will be no more than grist for its mill.The film's full of stereotypical character and they're not worth going into. Well, one example -- the wealthy coward who tries to buy his way into a lifeboat. More examples. (There are so many.) Here are the two lovers clinging to the flagstaff as they plung into the see. ""This is where we first met!"", she says breathlessly. Earlier the couple find a brand new automobile in the cargo. He leaps into the driver's seat and beeps the ancient horn gaily, as in a Walt Disney movie. She sits elegantly in the coach. ""Where to?"" he asks. ""Take me to the stars!,"" she chirps. There's a subplot involving a stolen jewel, straight out of Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes movies. Basically this is a megabuck special effects extravaganza built around a B-movie script.So much is lost. Like the irony of the California, sitting a few miles away, watching and misinterpreting the Titanic's distress rockets. The piling up of personal telegrams that kept the radio officer too busy to tend to the ice warnings.The Titanic disaster was an interesting lesson in sociology though, factually speaking. Women and children only, right? Very gentlemanly. Very Edwardian.And most of the women in first class passage were in fact saved. A far lesser proportion of women and kids in second class were saved, and only a handful from third class. You can actually MEASURE the relative impact of social class, gender, and age.I don't want to make this film sound like the catastrophe that the Titanic's first voyage was. If you liked, say, ""Pearl Harbor,"" you'll probably like this. It has pretty much the same structure.There's something else that occurred to me while watching this though. When should we just leave the real Titanic alone? Some years ago, Telly Savalas was featured in a TV program called something like, ""Treasures from the Titanic,"" in which he displayed and described items retrieved from the wreck and the surrounding sea floor. Savalas gave his best imitation of a carnival barker. You know, smiling, holding up a boot for the camera, pronouncing, ""This was somebody's shoe. Imagine. Someone wearing this shoe as the stately liner made its final descent."" The disarticulated carcass of the Titanic is a giant necropolis, filled with human remains and, who knows?, benthic ghosts. It's a burial ground of sorts. Should we really go searching among the bodies for watches and gold teeth?",5
91,"Titanic ... what a movie! What a masterpiece! I've seen it dozens of times, and I'll never get tired of it. I always end in tears at the end. I find it underestimated by some, it is really a great cinema film. The achievement is magnificent, the casting is incredible. Thank you James Cameron ! This film is already 22 years old, and it ages very well. Timeless !",10
92,"On a purely technical level, Titanic was considered at the time the crowning achievement of a filmmaker who's always strived to top his last cinematographic entry with the next. Up until that point and still to this day, he's managed to do just that. He's always made the most of the technological advantages at the time and always come up with a jaw-dropping, mesmerizing visual spectacle. Even at times when budget constraints and uncooperative technical crew, due in part for his apparent lack of experience and fresh off- the- boat from his first serious outing on the directorial chair for The Terminator, like it was the case in Aliens, he's always managed to deliver. It sure does take him a long time to come up with the next one, but everytime he does, he hits the box office's bullseye.
This time around and, with one of the more simplistic storylines ever put to the big screen, he brings us one of the most memorable and fondly remembered movies of the late 90s.
From the very first shot of the movie, those sepia color-corrected images that convey a haunting feeling of remembrance and loss, to the first images of the research vessel subs exploring the entrails of the haunted ship, we plunge right into what it must have felt like walking onto the deck of the Titanic. And we go back to the plot. As I said before, using the simplest of plot devices, a , on the other hand, very well told love story with tinges of social clashing, we are treated to a 3 hour, eye - catching spectacle that moves along at a whip-like pace. With very strong performances all throughout, gorgeous cinematography and production design, state-of-the-art visual and practical effects and a perfect score by the great late James Horner, this is probably one of Cameron's best efforts behind the camera and a movie for the ages. Needless to say, the strongest asset of the movie is its third and final act, with the depiction of the sinking of the titular ship and the resulting mayhem. That, as always, and with the character development groundwork previously laid out by Cameron, is the main reason to watch this movie, and why the audience is so invested in what's happening onscreen. As I said, great movie and larger-than-life characters to go with it.",10
93,"You can watch this movie in 1997, you can watch it again in 2004 or 2009 or you can watch it in 2015 or 2020, and this movie will get you EVERY TIME. Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding!Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!",8
94,"One of the monuments of the cinema which won 11 Oscars in Hollywood in 1998, a huge success (well deserved) all over the world. The revelation of two actors until then virtually unknown. This is James Cameron' masterpiece. He chose to relate the tragedy of the Titanic that took place on the 12th of April 1912, through the intermediary of a love story lived between a wealthy and pretty young woman (Kate Winslet) and a modest painter (Léonardo Dicaprio). Cameron succeeds in making it fascinating in the first part of the movie. The love between ""Jack"" and ""Rose"" is so strong that can hardly believe the Titanic will bump into an iceberg and will sink. It's also together with a model bravery that the two lovers will try to escape the ship's sinking (although historically accurate).Léonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet will stay among the famous mythical couples in the cinema's history. It's obvious that they are between the hands of a conscientious and carefully organized film-maker. James Cameron doesn't leave anything high and dry. He adopted a sustained rhythm not spoiled by the enormous means that he's got. It's useless to say that he masters them perfectly thanks to an important budget. Not only has this budget enabled a meticulous reconstruction of the ship but it has also enabled a reconstruction from the traditional life in 1912 with its contrasts, its oppositions. Moreover, the movie enjoys an outstanding performance from all the actors, even the minor ones and several sequences and dialogs don't lack humor.But ""Titanic"" is also a limited place where takes place the confrontation of two different worlds: the proletarians and the middle-class persons. This confrontation is particularly well described during the ship's sinking: the rich are by the lifeboats whereas the poor are still inside the ship and they're forbidden to go outside.The second part of the movie is remarkably well filmed and follows a logical advance based on the increase of fear and distress. Cameron emphasizes particularly on the madness that spread to the passengers but also on the officers. Little by little, these last ones are becoming mad (one of them will kill unwittingly one of the passengers who was trying to get into a lifeboat). Besides, a few touches make the movie surrealist (the four musicians keep on playing while the ship's sinking)The other obvious qualities: a gorgeous music, some smart costumes. At the end, a movie that creates a deep emotion and where everything contributes to a perfect success.",10
95,This film is the best motion picture in my opinion.,10
96,"James Cameron does not do small films, even his breakout film The Terminator was hitting way above its budget. This is down to Cameron himself and his extreme work ethic to get the money right up there on the screen. This film often gets poor reviews from people, mainly due to its immense commercial success. However this success is truly deserving. There is no other film maker out there who can produce a film on this kind of scale and still pull it off. I was lucky enough to see it at the cinema in 1997. Straight off to even consider diving to the Titanic wreck itself to film it for the movie would be considered insane, Cameron did it 12 times. The film was pitched as Romeo and Juliet on Titanic and Cameron immediately got funded. The film ran massively over budget and there was huge concern at the time that the whole project would implode. However Cameron knew he was onto something special, creating a stunning replica of the Titanic itself, along with exact decor and furniture, props, clothing, even tableware. Cameron cast Romeo himself from the 1996 film Romeo and Juliet, Leonardo Di Caprio. This was a masterstroke as Di Caprio was gaining unrivalled stardom after the 1996 film. Kate Winslet is fantastic as Rose, as a young actress to have that level of scale all resting on your performance to make it all come to life, she pulled it off amazingly and often does not get the credit she deserves. The real star of the show though is the ship itself and its master film director James Cameron. When the ship starts sinking and Cameron moves into his action mode, there is no-one better in the world at pacing action them Cameron, he is a master of suspense at the exact right moments. He is an exceptional story teller and fully deserved all the accolades he has acquired. I highly recommend Titanic and encourage you to watch it on the largest screen possible, films like this do not come along often. The 3d Blu ray is also exceptional and shows what can be done when a 2d film is converted in the right hands into 3d.",10
97,"Thirteen years after Titanic launched and all it takes is the first few bars of that haunting music to transport me back to my first time watching the movie in the theater. It was beyond comprehension - the entire spectacle and production. I bought the books, read the history books and found myself immersed in all things Titanic.I didn't hurt that my great, great aunt was on the ship and survived. It makes it a little personal for me. In fact, I happen to own one of the only objects in existence that came off of the ship into a lifeboat and did not go into the water.Love the movie - it still is #1 in my book.",10
98,"There is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film. Let's just face it, though, the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this film. I'm not saying they're not good actors, I'm saying they stunk in this film. The special effects were decent (and I will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye-pleasing), but IT even has several major flaws. For instance, right before the ship goes under, you can see an unfinished blue-screen image behind your main characters.Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the story of the REAL Titanic, but I find this movie an insult to that story. Editing was atrocious--there's no reason for any film to be over 2 1/2 hours (with the exception of MAYBE a biographical movie), and the writing and screenplay was horribly stilted.I will say that the music was perhaps better than I could have predicted (and not just the ""My Heart Will Go On"" song either). There is one scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and pounding bass music is heard. That could very well be the highlight of the film. As for the mood throughout, it was extremely dull. I was more relieved than sad when Jack died, which I know cannot be what the director intended.In a nut shell, I find it horrible that they turned the beautiful story of the Titanic into an over-hyped chick flick.",8
99,"I admit I enjoyed this film.  The grandeur of it all was impressive.  The fact that James Cameron let this film get to a 200 million dollar budget is also very impressive.  However, once the grandeur is taken away there really isn't much left.  The plot is a simple romance.  And since the story is so predictable, it puts some heavy pressure on a three hour film.  The direction is superb.  My distaste for this film doesn't extend to James Cameron's technical direction.  His technical direction is on par with Spielberg's.  However, his human/emotional part of that mix doesn't rate very well.  The acting also is not consistent.  I didn't find DiCaprio's performance bad, but his character seemed to be very easy to play and wasn't that complicated.  Winslet, who's performance in Heavenly Creatures stunned me, is mainly okay here.  The best performances belonged to Gloria Stuart and Kathy Bates.  The score also rates with the best, and the soundtrack is one I highly recommend.  In the end, I think this film is more comparable to ""Cleopatra"" than to ""Gone With Wind"".  The budget and the problems making the film end up being more interesting and more entertaining than the film itself.  Did this film deserve best picture? No.  But it's nomination was also like ""Cleopatra's"" nomination.  The big budget and the absolute vastness of the film was enough.",

102,"The tale of the doomed ocean liner Titanic remains continually ripe for cinematic exploration.  Films, series and documentaries continue to abound on this most famous tragedy.  Encompassed within the simple tale of the demise of an 'unsinkable ship' is a story of intense tragedy (over 1,500 lives were lost), social divide (the rich/poor gap was highlighted here when the first class passengers were the first on the lifeboats, leaving many in steerage to die) and most of all, of man's arrogance and opportunism overwhelmed by the forces of nature.If anyone could bring this tale into 21st century (when it was only 1997!) it had to be James Cameron.  Cameron had the technical experience and flair necessary to build and sink the Titanic onscreen.  Sex and violence are par for the course in almost every action movie but, like his special effects, Cameron inventively works these elements to make them serve his story.So it is with ""Titanic"", where he uses a pair of doomed, starstruck lovers as a focal point for the audience to empathise and relate to the passengers on the ship.  The film begins in the present day where a diamond-hunting mercenary Brock Lovett (Cameron regular Bill Paxton) stumbles on a picture of a nude young woman wearing the diamond he is trying to locate.  Lovett is shocked when a very old lady (Gloria Stuart) identifies herself as the woman in the picture.  She comes aboard his vessel and relates to him and his team her experiences on Titanic.Cut back to 1912 and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) boards the ocean liner Titanic a sullen rich young woman.  She's being pushed by her mother (Frances Fisher) into a loveless marriage with Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), a vain self-centred tycoon.  The deadening misery of her life leads her to attempt suicide, but encounters Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a penniless artist who won his ticket in a poker game.  He saves her life, and they fall in love. But despite all their efforts, the affair cannot last,  especially when the ship strikes an iceberg and with not enough lifeboats, it's a race for survival...Cameron is especially keen on highlighting the class divide between rich and poor on Titanic.  The rich are shown as staid, self-centred and repressed, caring only about their money and their social status.  By contrast, the poor are shown as lively, honest, down-to-earth and fun.  The depiction is crudely stereotypical, but it works in favour of the story.  When they're locked below decks during the ship's sinking, you empathize with them and want them to get out.  Once the iceberg is sighted, no shot is wasted in cranking up the tension. Every aspect of the ship's sinking is seen, from the initial iceberg impact to the flooding corridors, the on-deck chaos as passengers struggle to board the lifeboats, to the grand final sinking.  Cameron further shows the aftermath of the sinking, with hundreds of survivors screaming and thrashing in the water as they slowly freeze to death.  All this works through superlative cinematography, special effects, editing, all underlined by James Horner's worthy music score.  The human element is not lost amid the action.  Leonardo DiCaprio is not rough-and-ready enough to really convince as a seen-it-all poor boy, but makes a good go of it, and is well partnered with Kate Winslet, who makes for a buxom, comely Rose.  Billy Zane (as Cal) and David Warner (as his manservant) make for slick, hateable villains and Frances Fisher brings Rose's mother a step up from simple caricature.The fictional characters blend in well with the real passengers, all of whom don't possess much depth but are still very well acted.  Standouts include Jonathan Hyde as the opportunistic Ismay, Kathy Bates as Molly Brown and Victor Garber as the ship's sympathetic architect.When the film returns to the present, you really do feel as though you were on Titanic, and it's hard to suppress a tear at the misty, dreamlike finale.Epic, and unforgettable.",
103,"I have never whatched this movie in thweright way, i mean i alredy seen scenes and watched some parts when i was a kid but today a sit to really see this one in a life time master piece, this movie is full emotions, you feel love, despair, fear, you laugh, you cry, you feel bad for these chracters and most import you belive in their love, and is a wonderfull exemple of storytelling, cameron is one of the best filmmakers of all time and this movie is one of the proofs!

105,"I finally saw Titanic when it was on network television last week. I had been avoiding it because I didn't think I would like it. I hadn't liked any of James Cameron's other films and I didn't think I would be able to make it through the entire 3 hours. The first half was like a Merchant-Ivory production and it was much better than I expected. The second half was basically a remake of the Poseidon Adventure and it was pretty much what I expected.My favorite part of the film did not involve any of the lead characters. It was when the boat was about to sink and the string quartet had finished their last piece of music. They said their goodbyes and started walking away, then the violinist started playing solo. The other members came back and joined him. This part of the film showed that the musicians knew they had nowhere else to go because they were going to die. While most of the other passengers were panicking, the musicians chose to die doing what they loved most.That one touching scene made the movie worthwhile for me. While I don't consider it a great film and it is way too long, it is much better than I ever thought James Cameron was capable of. 7/10",9
106,"Everything about this movie it's garbage . Inane ,dull or boring are too gentle words to describe how bad is this movie .I don't care anything about all the hype that this movie receives ,or that it won the Academy Award of best movie (so what ? Many bad movies receive a lot of praise and prizes for the success that those movies have in the box office rather than in the real artistic value ) The acting it's bad and all the story it's a bad soap opera that uses history as a excuse to tell the story of all the days . Deep inside ,it's just a glorified chick -flick . I'm not amazed that it was chosen to be part of the list ""100 years ,100 stinkers "" .

107,"Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) is searching for a legendary gem called The Heart of the Ocean presumed lost on the Titanic. When he finds a drawing instead, Rose (Gloria Stuart/Kate Winslet) comes on board and tells her story of Titanic and her love Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). She's a wealthy girl destined for a loveless marriage to the hateful Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). He's a wandering artist who won his Titanic ticket in a poker game. He would save her in every way that a person can be saved.I have often railed against the insertion of a love story unnecessarily into a historical event like 'Pearl Harbor'. But I think James Cameron made the right decision here. The story is compelling by itself. Leo has that boyish charm. Kate and Leo has become a legendary Hollywood big screen pairing. This time it works because it's well written, and well acted.There is the great CGI. It's relatively seamless, and ahead of its times. The engine room is magnificent, even better than the boat itself. The iceberg hit was very convincing.Then there is the sinking. For something that is absolutely expected, it still shocks. The suspense of it all holds my attention every time. The last hour of the movie is perhaps one of the most tension filled sequence of all times. It is the incredible CGI as well as the amazing stunts. It marries the real world with the computer world, and have rarely been exceeded even to this day. It is more harrowing than all those 3D superheroes smashing into skyscrapers. For it's iconic status, I have to give this 9/10.",9

It's definitely the kind of movie that you catch more/different things every time you watch it. Of course, it's hard not to notice the powerful scenery, emotional music, amazing costumes, and breathtaking cinematography.",8
109,"I saw this film long ago but remember that it took my breath away and we are still talking about this movie.
The fictional story of two main actors was absolutely beautiful. Kate Winslet was gorgeous as Rose and i couldn't imagine anyone else playing this role. And Leonardo DiCaprio was really good as Jack. The acting is first-rate. Leonardo Di Caprio's and Kate Winslet's performance is so brilliant that I cried during the whole movie.
This movie has it all; drama, action, romance and it makes the viewer fall in love with each and every scene. Also it is very close to the real tragedy. It shows a beautiful love story with an extremely sad ending.It's emotionally so powerful that it breaks the viewer into tears.
If you want to cry and melt down to a glamurous love story, I strongly recommend that you watch this movie. Titanic is well worth seeing.AizereTitanic is very tough movie to watch and this film is directed by James Cameron.The film is not new, but does not go out of fashion, does not leave indifferent even a person who is used to constantly hide emotions. Shown fear and love. It is instructive and even interesting to look at the behavior of people from the side, as if with the actors of the film you are experiencing what is happening in the film. Sometimes it seems that this is reality, but pincing yourself by the arm you understand that this is only a film. There is no pretense in the game of actors, it pleases me.I really liked the film, I can't even say exactly what, just EVERYTHING with which it was made. Watching it, I feel myself there on the Titanic, after the film I immediately begin to have a value in life, I would never want to die like these people who were on board. I would even like to see the Titanic myself with my own eyes at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.The film has touched my soul so much that I don't think there is a film that will surpass the Titanic in its drama. This is my favorite movie from melodramas, and one of my favorite films in general. I really advice to watch this masterpiece.",10
110,"I was watching football on my Sky go and titanic was on in the background. As the ship hit the iceberg you know that it's getting to the best part so my attention soon switched.Seriously one of the best, most iconic films ever. Beautiful couple. Disasterous circumstances. 'Can't take your eyes off the screen' moments. A true classic.",9
111,"It's hard to believe that nearly nine years have passed since this movie came out. It's a masterpiece of special effects and storytelling, even if the romance schmaltzes it up a bit. I'm not too critical about films that stretch the truth. If that were not the case, we would only watch documentaries, and, of course, many of those are suspect. In addition to the incredible recreation of the Titanic and the people who sailed her, there is an air of mystery maintained throughout, accentuated by the incredible music score. The fact that we all know the story and the result makes us voyeurs to history. I enjoyed this movie, and yet it made me sad. I sat next to a couple of twenty something types with their baseball caps on backwards, yelling ""all right"" when a falling body would smack against an obstruction as it plummeted down the length of the capsizing ship. I sat in awe of the power of nature and imagined those poor people dying from the stupidity of an overconfident shipbuilder and captain. I know it's just a movie, but it had a really connection to my heart. The business with Leonardo de Caprio and Kate Winslet didn't really grab me. What did was that there was a hopelessness beyond anything we can fathom. If you read my review of ""A Night to Remember,"" also a fine film from much earlier, you will see that it's about people saying goodbye to their wives and children and to another day that makes this event so horrible. It's quite a marvelous movie. We may have forgotten that in the wake of all the attention it received, including parodies and spoofs.",9
112,"One of my biggest childhood memories was seeing Titanic in the theatre. I was only 7 years old when it was first released and I had no idea what a hell of a ride I was in for. My father always had a keen interest in the Titanic and its sinking, and I remember a large Atlas like book he had of the Titanic full of pictures of the wreckage, the dive teams efforts, salvage operations, etc.It was just after Christmas 1997. We went to my grandparents for a weeks holiday. During our visit, the adults decided we were all going to go and see Titanic. So we arrive at the cinema, walk in through the front entrance and there's a line-up like you can't even imagine. a huge line-up, of people, all hoping to get in and see Titanic. we stood in line for a few minutes until an usher came and yelled out ""ALL THOSE WANTING TO SEE TITANIC, TICKETS ARE SOLD OUT FOR TODAY!"", and I think that was my first inkling of ""wow this movie really is a big deal"", So dad went to the ticket booth and got us tickets for two days later, in a 3pm session that had enough tickets left for all five of us.Fast forward two days, we go in and get our seats for the 3pm session, the cinema is jam packed, i'm talking not one seat free. three incredible hours later, we walk out of the theatre, walk back through the shopping centre and get in our 4WD to drive back to nan and pops. The second I got in the car, I was just totally mesmerized the entire way home, thinking about this movie and constantly repeating wow, wow wow, inside my head. As a seven year old kid, Seeing this, all I can say this movie had me gobsmacked.Anyway, onto the movie...A 101 year old woman Rose sees a drawing of a young nude teenager on TV that was recovered from the wreckage, she quickly realizes the nude girl in the drawing is in fact her. She gets into contact with Brock Lovett (played effortlessly by Bill Paxton), who conducts frequent dive and salvage operations of the Titanic's wreckage. He is searching for a lost treasure known as the Heart of the Ocean which is an extremely rare and insanely valuable diamond. After a very disappointing failed salvage attempt, Rose and Brock come into contact and Rose is flown out to their salvage boat, Where rose ends up telling a group (including her granddaughter, Lizzy) her entire story on the Titanic from start to finish.Her story begins with Her arriving in Southampton with her mother, fiancé, Cal (played wonderfully by Billy Zane), and Mr Lovejoy (David Warner), who kind of acts like family security. We are introduced to a young and very beautiful Kate Winslet. The Titanic is still docked and the docks are crowded with avid passengers and enthusiastic spectators, all itching to see the Titanic set off on its maiden voyage. We are introduced to the handsome and mischievous Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his friend Fabrizzio in a tense poker game. They're lucky enough to win tickets on board and merely make it on board.The next portion of the film has various characters talking about the Titanic's construction, kind of as a way to feed the audience some background knowledge I guess. We're introduced to the ship's owner, builder and a whole array of other first and third class citizens. After Rose explains how depressed she was starting to feel after being caught up in the madness of being a first class citizen, and being forced to marry someone she denies her love for, we see Rose upset and about to jump off the ship committing suicide. Here, we have a lovely and eerily quiet introduction between Rose and Jack. For assisting Rose, Her fiancé cal, invites him to dinner in first class the following evening. We see the clear distinction between Third and first class. Jack has no idea how to behave like a first class citizen, and portrays that very nicely on screen to the point where it's actually quite humorous. Later on in the film, after a few more dramas, we see what I can only describe as the most Iconic and memorable on scree kiss, of any movie in history. Now we come to the part of the film we came to see. The sinking. The remainder of the film is pure epic. We see the ship slowly sinking, more water rushing through the various floors and decks, the passengers becoming progressively more panicked, The captain trapping himself in the wheel house, people turning on each other, distressed children and parents, people jumping off the ship into the freezing ocean trying to survive and it's incredible how much you do actually feel like you're there on the ship. All of it was done in studios but it literally does look like its sinking into a real ocean. And the scene where the ship splits in two, was the icing on the cake for me. After the ship has sunk, the survivors floating in the ocean become slowly more and more quiet, until there's complete silence. I still to this day find it a very eerie and disturbing part of the film. All in all, Titanic is quite simply put, just a ground breaking piece of cinema. The film makers got the Era spot on in terms of clothing and how characters look and behave, and as I understand got the look of the Titanic's interior spot on for the time period too. It really does feel like you're back in 1912, and it's always a movie I can come back to every few years and enjoy it as if it was my first time seeing it as a 7 year old. Phenomenal film. 10 out of 10. Fox.",
113,"I wake up in the middle of the night with total anxiety.While the fictional story line is fairly cliche and some of the characters are a little cringe (Bill Paxton's hair and earring, for example), the truth is this: 1,517 people died horrible deaths in the icy Atlantic in the dead of night. That eats at me constantly. I think of some of them being all cozy in their beds, happily dreaming of going to America, and suddenly they are waken by the rumbling of the iceberg hit, by the alarms, by the sounds of rising panic and the unbelievably coldness of the weather and water. It saddens me to this day.I caught the movie yet again while channel surfing and sure enough, I stopped and ended up watching the last 90 minutes. The recreation of the sinking is amazing and horrifying. The details presented put you right there. I always put myself in that situation mentally and I wonder what would have become of me. No one can truly know until it actually happens. I think about the cold more than anything. I have been in very cold places before, but never getting soaking wet in that cold. The people who ended up alive in the water went through a horrible hell for a few minutes then hypothermia drifted them off to their deaths. It's haunting to think about. I woke up around 3am after having a dream I was in icy water, trying to catch my breath, trying to stay afloat, and not doing very well at either. The anxiety level increased as I began to wake up and I got mad at myself for watching the movie right before going to bed!My thoughts go out to those souls who perished on the Titanic and I hope beyond hope that there is a better place they went to.",10
114,"This was the best experience of watching Titanic I've ever had. 3D.
It was truly a more lively experience with this format. Moisted my eyes again. The casting, the music, the scenes...TITANIC indeed.",9
115,"To admit this is the first time I have watched TITANIC from A to Z might hinder my credibility as a serious film critic (as least a self-acclaimed title), I have had several sketchy viewings during all these years but never conquered it entirely, then all of sudden it occurred to me a few days ago this is the biggest loophole in my filmography which I should mend ASAP, so after the lengthy 3 hour saga, now I could feel calmer in facing the numerous household names still stuck in my to-be-watched list and meanwhile other potential newcomers have never stopped emerging.To be honest with oneself, no one could deny TITANIC is a monumental masterpiece, the visual stunts are so compelling and marvel me in its verisimilitude of reconstructing such a monolith setting (what's more indomitable is the fact that it has survived a 15 year interval which should have been a light-year in the evolution of digital technology, and will still stand out not only among its peers). Also the film is a well-crafted emotional vehicle of a catastrophe depicting in an impeccable way to render immaculate empathy towards its audience as if we were literally heading towards our own doomsday (I did redden my eyes when the valedictory score was accompanying the final farewell). The love story of Jack and Rose, although being a bit predictable and the black or white of the character development is somewhat perfunctory given the ample running time it has, could universally strike a chord in any corner of the world, DiCaprio and Winslet have generated unparalleled chemistry on screen (especially for Kate, since she has a more narrative arc to accomplish). Billy Zane, whose past 15 years has testified that he could never outshine this tailor-made character. Gloria Stuart and Katy Bates are both in my top 10 list of the supporting category, and since I'm re-watching DOWNTON ABBEY these days, whose correlation with TITANIC has suggested that all the first-class passengers don't need to change any outfit to be grafted into the red-hot show, maybe Katy Bates could reprise her role as the survival of the calamity, Julian Fellowes might give it a shot. To be the all-time highest grossing film in North America, and the runner-up if put under the international parameter (after Cameron's own brooding AVATOR 2009, 9/10), TITANIC has every reason to be loved by the majority of the mass, and it may not be among the top- tier darling among orthodox film critics, but will remain as a tenacious one in my list. Another afterthought is that I hope AVATOR will look as fabulous as TITANIC now when 2024 eventually arrives.",9
116,"The movie in question revolves around the infamous shipwreck of 1912 where more than 1500 people lost their lives when the commuting leviathan sunk on its maiden voyage to the States. The movie made it big globally, had a great box office run and also managed to win a record of Academy Awards. The question, however, is – was this movie really that good? In my opinion, Titanic, while not intrinsically bad, is an overrated cinematic venture. For a disaster movie it was too foppish and the treatment of a potentially rich subject matter, not exemplary . There was a visible disconnect between the storyline and the intended tone of the movie. Mr. Cameron, the director of the movie, is known for his sci-fi ventures, while the present movie required a far more realistic and even subdued treatment. Strangely, the movie devoted more screen time to the on screen romance of the two lead characters than it actually did to the eponymous vessel, which diverted attention from the focal event- the shipwreck. The director could have downplayed the romantic angle and instead given the audience a few moments of pensive repose to digest the enormity of the tragedy being depicted. Cinematizing real life tragedy is never easy, and requires a careful treatment of subject matter. Though undoubtedly a visual stunner, replete with amazing special effects, something the director excels in, the movie somehow could not achieve the same penetration when it came to dramatization. Titanic suffered from sufficient thematic and directorial inadequacies to warrant only moderate adulation and not the inordinate ovation it surprisingly received.",3
117,"""Titanic""(ship of dreams)It's one of the greatest movie of all time
Story is really amazing or heart touching
how the ship was sunk it was heartbreaking based on true eventEspecially cast :Rose and Jack what a wonderful chemistry has been portrayed in the movie these two characters played their role extremely amazing movie also reflects the class differences where elite dominant and poor has to sacrifice.
Credit goes to James Cameron his direction or selection of characters
Titanic will remain unforgettable.",10
118,"There are many who say Titanic is ""overrated"", ""over-hyped"" or some might inexplicably go as far to say ""boring"" and ""pointless"". The hardly arguable biggest blockbuster of the 90s, grossing near 2 billion at the box office and winning 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture, has attained some hate from people over the years, people who love to hate this movie for everything they so wrongly think it is not and never will be. It has, however, attained a very positive social status among a lot of people whom their hearts were captured by this masterpiece. Those people can see just how magnificent of a movie this really is, and how underrated a classic it appears to be in today's film society; a dazzling and striking accomplishment in itself and never overlooked, but unfairly maligned by many.The movie, aside from being set on the Titanic and called Titanic, actually has a love story that renders up most of the movie time, as most would already know. This love story, is positively brilliant in every sense of the word. I am always amazed and captivated to watch it play out on screen, because Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, who were furiously snubbed out of Best Actor/Actress awards, have wonderful chemistry, giving me chills in lots of scenes, and they both separately give incredulous performances that enthrall and charm every step of the way as well. These two characters' strong likability, along with James Cameron's directing and the entirely fascinating special effects make this movie something much more than mere entertainment. The movie is excellently executed in the best manner it could be, the Bill Paxton and Gloria Stuart present day story being very interesting as well, and a lot of the film's aspects are quite simply riveting and awe-inspiring whether it's the love story, the intensity in all the performances or the infamous, brilliantly portrayed sinking and sets that give true heart to the story of the Titanic and shows it's revelation quite undeniably like any other film on the subject.While ""My Heart Will Go On"", receiving the Academy Award for Best Original Song, has attained some criticism from people as well, it makes the perfect score and theme song for every scene it is used in regarding the movie, especially the climax, which has had millions in tears, had me in tears, and always has me in tears when I watch it, even if it is not the saddest movie of all time, because it isn't. It's a film about love, a film about disaster, a film about memories, and it is beautifully shown how all of those three attributes tie into peoples' lives, but I am not melancholy, I am merely pleased with how stunning of a film it is, and how remarkably well it has held up over the years, not being overthrown by any blockbusters in recent years in likes of quality, in my honest opinion. James Cameron, even if not one of my favorite directors, is very talented and it shows with this movie. I do not understand a lot of the reasons why so many hate this, or do not find it as remarkable of a film as fans like me do, but I ensure you, this movie will always have a place in my heart, and will go down as a classic, already has even and will contine to whether haters like it or not, because of how many people were touched by it and are still touched by it. Underrated, powerful, breath-taking movie that, since holding up in quality on every watch, I intend to love for many more years to come.",10
119,"""Titanic""....this movie on the surface would normally strike fear into the hearts of film fans like myself, who usually despise most typical mainstream drivel. While I am a huge film fan, I rarely go to the movies in theaters anymore because everything just looks so BAD. The last film I have seen in theaters was actually ""Spider-Man,"" a great film marred by the horrible cartoonish special effects.My tastes in film vary greatly...I love the classics (Cagney, Bogie, etc), romance, B-flicks, Godzilla films, car chases, superhero stuff and much more. However, almost all the films I like were made before the 90's, when film started to get REALLY bad. I also love to observe a good phenomenon - whoch ""Titanic"" became almost instantly.I read all about ""Titanic"" before it was released, how the budget went up to a staggering $200 million making the film a tremendous gamble. When it was released in late '97, it did very good but not great numbers - but the word of mouth on this film was unlike anything seen since Star Wars probably - the box office take remained steady for a LONG time. As weeks went by, it actually earned more and more, and the phenomenon had started.Then in late 1998, when the film was still playing some theaters almost a year later, and for a whole year we've heard how unbelievable ""Titanic"" was and how Leo was adored by girls all over the world and how hot Kate was - I finally kicked in 2 bucks at a discount theater to see what all the fuss was finally about. Alone (in a packed theater) as not to be distracted by a friend, I got my snick snacks, found my seat, and watched with a completely open mind.Three hours later, I, who again hates virtually everything mainstream these days, said to myself, that was one of the greatest films I had ever seen.Many say ""Titanic"" is ""fomulatic,"" ""typical Hollywood drivel,"" and the famous, ""...but we know the ending, the ship sinks."" I say, ""Titanic"" was an extremely rare present-day excursion in old-school grandiose film-making. Huge sets were built as opposed to having everything drawn with computer effects. It was a great romantic story, which the audience was compelled to feel for, especially having the knowledge ahead of time that it would be doomed (""the ship sinks""). It had great drama, great music (even the one song I can stand hearing Celine Dion sing), and a lot of heart from James Cameron who, love him or hate him, showed amazing dedication to getting his epic on screen.And say whatever you want about Leonardo DiCaprio - he was excellent in Titanic and is one of the very best actors out there right now.Anyone who has read some of my other reviews would know that I hate computer effects. But the CGI in ""Titanic"" is the one instance where they actually do work a little, because they do not overtake the picture and aren't the focus. It definitely is not the same as watching a cartoon Spider-Man battle a cartoon Green Goblin in a film that is not supposed to be a cartoon.""Titanic,"" dare I say, is the ""Gone With The Wind"" of our time. it's a huge movie, a blood, sweat and tears movie, a movie with some real elbow grease behind it. And never boring for a second.""Titanic"" is arguably the best film of the 90's (only ""Goodfellas"" gives it a run for that title in my opinion), and is probably one of the greatest 40 films ever made. Now that may be a surprising thing for me to say given I am such a huge fan of the classics, but however rare it may be, there are extremely rare instances when something new is in the same league as something classic.One last note - it is surprising that this film has such a bare-bones DVD out. While there are rumors that a ""special edition"" DVD is in the works, the present DVD is a disappointment with no extras at all. Considering this movie at three hours long had two hours CUT from it alone would make some good extras in deleted scenes. Add on the commentaries, a few ""makings of"" and add on a bunch of other crap and you have got a killer, proper DVD release for ""Titanic.""",10
120,"I may not make myself popular with this statement but I hate Titanic. One reason is that it is far too long for a Hollywood movie. It spends most of its time waffling on and on and on. I went to see it in the cinema when it released it 97, it didn't impress me then it doesn't impress me now. I have liked James Cameron's previous work like Terminator and True lies but he has really disappointed this time around.Now onto the good points. The last scene was so moving and the song My heart will go on is one of my favourites. Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet were very good in their roles. I feel that it should have been made like a documentary rather than a standard 90's disaster movie. On the other hand there are millions of titanic fans and I have been known to have unusual tastes in movies. Go and see it and decide for yourself",2
121,"While I admit that the effects were good and the costumes worked - the film as a whole was awful. Kate Winslett was horribly miscast and there was no chemistry between her character and DiCaprio's Jack. The script was dire and the baddies were just missing their twirly moustaches. It was difficult to care about what happened to anyone at any point during the interminable denouement. it seemed to me that like many other Cameron movies the bottom line was the profit to be made from the extreme overhyping of the whole thing. Avatar was only just better (which is not to say it was any good either). Definitely the law of diminishing returns was played out here. I think it halted Leo's career in it's tracks, given the ""heartthrob"" title attributed to him. Conversely and inexplicably it boosted Kate's career beyond any explanation.",4
122,"I have watched Titanic dozens if not hundreds of times since I first got it on VHS as a kid in the 90s. I hadn't watched it for many years until the past few days when I watched it a few times in a row, and really appreciated it on a deeper level I felt, or maybe just remembered how truly great it is.Sure it has its cinematic flaws, such as seeing waves lapping at the shoreline next to the set when it should be the Titanic in the middle of the ocean.
But then again all films have their little quirks and errors scattered throughout. Despite those found in Titanic, the emotion that the film makes me feel is unmatched by any other movie. It is pure magic from start to finish, many times throughout the film my eyes well up with tears, or outright balling.It's one of the few movies that I would pay good money to see again in a massive full theatre.I really don't know why it's not in the IMDb top 250, when many films on the list are trash in comparison to Titanic, in my opinion.Titanic is in my Top 10 of all time, alongside Lord of the Rings, Hero, Kimi No Na Wa, Princess Mononoke, and Lonesome Dove, and others.",10
123,"This movie is *pitiful.* It is *abominable*. In terms of dung heaps, it is second only to ""Superman Returns."" That's not a very honorable position.Why do I hate ""Titanic,"" you may be wondering? Here's a list. 1) Leonardo di Caprio's performance as the lovable but down-on-his-luck guy could have been played better and more realistically by Paris Hilton. 2) Kate Winslet's fake American accent is the least of the woes left by her whiny, I'm-a-poor-widdle-rich-girl turn. 3) James Cameron should automatically be disqualified as the director of any real historical tragedy, because he makes us care more about the prettiness of the ship than the victims. 4) Where James Horner's music fails to nauseate (he was really off his game here), you always have the classic fallback: Celine Dion's mess of a theme song.Those are the top four reasons-- I could write a 52-page essay on why this movie is so horrid, but IMDb doesn't provide reviewers with that kind of space, so I'll condense it a wee bit.If you want to watch a disaster, this film is perfect... and I'm referring to the debacle of the film, not the Titanic incident.",1
124,"Kate Winslet is very pretty but that's the best thing about this film. It is a bog standard, formulaic love story about a poor boy / rich woman that drags on for way too long. Then the poor boy is inexplicably left to freeze to death when he could have just climbed on the raft - there was plenty of room. A ridiculous movie that doesn't deserve the praise and hype.",5
125,"The best romance I've ever seen
A very strong and well-constructed and great movie
Costly film was a timeless film in the history of the world of cinema",9
126,"It has kind of become the popular thing to kick Titanic, the film and its achievements. It's like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema, never happened, or as some want you to believe, doesn't matter. I can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately, under the influence of liquid refreshments, admit to having affection for the film, but socially in a circle environment? Not a bit of it! I have no such problems admitting my love for the film, I love it as much now as I approach 50, as I did when I sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997.You jump - I jump.Titanic is far from flawless, where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky. While it's true as well that away from Rose and Jack the characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is Rose and Jack's story, fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half. The tie-in to the present day is superbly constructed by James Cameron - the search for the diamond - the real life filming of the Titanic wreckage - and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful Gloria Stuart as old Rose, and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measure.Never let go.So may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever. The band playing on, the captain awaiting his fate, the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them, the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in, or just Jack and Rose, polar opposites in society's class structure, making love, making art or just professing that neither will ever let go. It's what makes Titanic the wonderful piece of cinema it is, where beauty and tragedy merge to create something forever memorable. A film that deserved all the accolades and cash till ringing that it once did have. 9/10",9
127,"Bloated neo-romantic crap are other fine discriptors of this movie. I honestly puke my guts out whenever the word titanic is mentioned. Hype, insulting plot, NON-Period sets, terrible lame dialogue, FAKE history all make this the worst blockbuster this side of phantom menace. Why do people like this movie so much? Really, pop-crap is what this is, nothing more. People proclaim James Cameron as some good director - this is the guy that directed ""Piranha Part Two: The Spawning"" for crying out loud! And if I see him on one more titanic type special I'm going to puke. Honestly, he already made a trillion dollars off of one shipwreck, can't he leave it alone already? Titanic sucks, OK? TITANIC SUCKS",1
128,"... and yet not nearly fast enough. When this movie first splashed onto the big screen, I was in the middle of the prime target: young, teenaged girls who all too easily swooned over the new ""it"" guy, Leo, and wanted a taste of ""adult"" love. Thank heavens I somehow missed it on that round, only to have one of my friends pull it out nearly a decade (has it really been so long?) later for a girl's night. I was stunned. The hype created by the Oscars and gushing of my peers set this movie on a pinnacle from whence the movie plummeted to the bottom of the ocean to join its namesake. If only they had left the story there. The first TWO HOURS were spent dilly-dallying aimlessly along the ship following Rose,a girl who is deprived a life by her dominating fiancée, her conniving mother, and ultimately her own self. She goes back and forth from suicidal to ""equal rights"" to ""you are not of my element"" with schizophrenic dexterity. I have great admiration for Kate Winslet, but this character was gratingly awful to watch. Mr. DiCaprio was little more than a pretty face during the movie. His lack of drive proves him not a knight in shining armor, but meh, he's just not as bad as the villain. And somehow, they fall madly into doomed love because *gasp* the ship is going to sink! So now, the ship has fiiiiinally begun to sink, but wait! You still have another HOUR to watch the main people get stuck, cut to people drowning, oh wait Rose and Jack are safe, cut to more drowning. Oh wait, the ships still sinking, so Rose and Jack aren't safe again, oh they're safe, wait no..... DIE ALREADY! So after three hours, Rose finally says I'll never let go! upon which she immediately lets go and is magically found unfrozen in a colony of frozen solid bodies. Yes, its amazing how it goes.So why 2 stars? I'll chalk it up to the romantic notion behind the ship, which has managed to still fascinate people a century later. The recreation of detail was admittedly stunning, although I got just as much out of a Titanic mystery computer game. Normally, even if I don't care for a movie, I'd say knock yourself out if you still wanna see it, but at 3 painful hours long, I'd definitely go with a no.",2

131,"This movie right here is ""Overrating"" in its prime.""The most compelling movie of the century"". That's a joke.My question is: Why? Why Cameron? Why did you do it??? You're WAY better than this! But, since Cameron created some cinematic masterpieces like ""The Terminator"" and ""Aliens"", I'm willing to let this one slide. You got lucky this time, Cameron.This movie was nothing but one misplaced drama scene after another. And it wasn't like you could sit through them easily either, this movie was more than 3 hours long! I understand that a lot of people liked this movie, and that maybe I'm being biased, but I really did not like this ""garbage"".Don't get me wrong, there were some very good scenes, and some music score that was decent. But the tear jerker moments grew tiresome quickly. Why are Billy Zane and Bill Paxton wasting their time here? Good scenes and some interesting plot points could not save this mess of a bad drama. I'm sorry, but this Hollywood trash reeks and stains the true story of the Titanic, almost to the point of disgracing it.If you like too much drama and romance badly put together with bad acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, ""Titanic"" is what you want.4/10",4

133,"Being of a rather sensitive nature, I steered clear of ""Titanic"", mostly because I did not want to witness the deaths of the 1500+ people who perished in the icy Atlantic waters in 1912. Thus I only recently saw the film on video, months after all the hype, the awards, and subsequent hoopla had played itself out. ""Titanic"" is certainly a lush, beautifully photographed and well-mounted film, although it is almost a bit too ""slick"" for my tastes. I thought Leo and Kate were blandly likable, but I was not very much interested in their characters or their performances. The supporting cast, however, was top-notch, in particular Frances Fisher's remarkably restrained performance as Rose's mother. Ms. Fisher did more acting with a 3-second, tight-lipped glance of disapproval then Leo did with 3 hours worth of stilted dialogue. And Billy Zane managed to twist his classically handsome features into an oily, and sometimes frightening, visage of callow shallowness. The wonderful Kathy Bates always lends a touch of class to whatever role she undertakes, and as Molly Brown she doesn't disappoint. I would have been much more interested in the plot if the story had been told from Molly's perspective rather than Rose's. But the real point of the film is the tragedy itself, which is depicted with harrowing, overwhelming clarity during the sinking sequence. On this level, I think the film is fully realized; however, the fictitious story line is seriously flawed, and I have a difficult time believing Leo as a romantic leading man. In ""Titanic"" he's more like the arrogant kid who should be taken to the woodshed and spanked.",8
134,"This is honestly the best romance movie I've ever seen. The effects of the movie were amazing. Yes I did cry to this movie and I have seen many depressing movies including Angela's Ashes (if you have not seen it then I recommend you do not see it b/c you will literally cry to death) and this has been the only movie I've cried to. And I don't care if you say its too depressing to watch. I watched it a second time and I cried just as much as I did as the first time. And you know what, it was great. If you have a girlfriend/wife, and if neither or one of you hasn't seen it, go see it together. She will cry (maybe) but you will get laid. How do I know this; experience. James Cameron, your movies are the best. Do not stop making movies. I really want to see what you will surprise everyone with next.",10
135,"After seeing this movie years ago at the cinema I thought it was one of the worst movies of all time (as far as major studio pictures go). Thinking about it before posting up a review here, maybe I was a bit too harsh.In short, this story is a fictional tale of two star-crossed lovers on board a real life, famous ship (the ""Titanic"") that sank, killing a great percentage of its passengers and crew (um, sorry if that is a spoiler, but sheesh, you SHOULD know that!).When I am feeling particularly unkind about this film, some of my criticisms are: only director James Cameron could look at the story of the Titanic and think ""Hmmm. That story could make a good movie...IF ONLY IT HAD MORE DRAMA!"". Yeah, sinking ship, hundreds dead, needs MORE drama!Another peeve about this movie is how Cameron can't resist manipulating our sympathies to characters by resorting to melodrama and crudely drawn characters who we find easy to hate, in order to have us rooting for other characters. E.g. Billy Zane's character of Hockley. Didn't quite throw a chihuahua into the ice-cold ocean, but nasty enough to do everything short of this. Really, a more sophisticated script could have made him a figure deserving of our sympathy too.A minor peeve is how one of those star crossed lovers, Kate Winslet's Rose, is quite prescient and insightful about the ship's situation...just didn't seem very plausible for one so young and unschooled in such matters.Despite thinking this movie one of the all time stinkers (for a major studio release) I did, at the time, think it a master-stroke to have the two star-crossed lovers at the centre of this tale (Kate Winslet's ""Rose"" and Leonardo DiCaprio's ""Jack""). It is just a brilliant device in order to hook you and reel you into this great historical drama/tragedy. Again, it was a great pity that Cameron chose not to make a victim of people like Hockley as well, instead of demonising him. And it's not as if Cameron didn't have alternatives in his own script. For instance, Jack's sketching of Rose could have provided a more believable foundation on which to base a relationship on instead of the hysterical melodrama Cameron resorts to to get them together.Perhaps the time-frame of the sinking made melodrama necessary.Truly spectacular but deserved Razzies for things like script and direction.Despite my criticisms, when Titanic eventually hits the ice-berg, the movie is an absolute thrill ride and quite exhilarating.P.S. must put in a word for the great Australian song by Flash and the Pan ""Down among the dead men"". It's not in this movie (Celine Dion does the theme song), but the Flash and the Pan song is actually about the Titanic and is a brilliant pop song...beautiful too. Look it up on You Tube.",4
136,"The increasing slight sense of foreboding, the humour at the climax that doesn't lighten up the tragedy but instead somehow makes it even more unsettling and ominous, the charming and extremely amiable star-crossed protagonists, to name a few. James Cameron's Titanic is one of the best indirect adaptations of Shakespeare's masterwork, Romeo and Juliet. Even when it comes to the issues I have with this film, most of them are pretty much similar to those I have with the play. And I've always found these issues justifiable to some extent. Also, the visuals are uniquely spectacular, and Céline Dion's My Heart Will Go On is timeless!(8.5/10)",8
137,"C+ The best grossing film of all time, until recently that is, but is it really the best film ever? Even worthy of getting all that money? Upon initial viewing, many probably thought so, but I'm not one of those. It does have its strong suits, and James Cameron has rarely, if ever, failed me. This film stands out as quite different in tone contrast to say ""Aliens', ""T2', or even ""Avatar"". Note the first two, f*CK Avatar, use low-key lighting, while this film is just so bright all the time. The performances are grade A in this film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are great throughout , and the end sequence was of course astonishing and a leap forward in visual effects.My biggest problem with this movie? It over does a love story to the point it hits two hours or so, and then we get an hour more or less of epic disaster with tragedy and believable chaos. But the first two hours just seem to drag on, quite unnecessarily at that. Along with that, the score was dismal at best. Naturally the only scene to defy this was the ""last song"" instant as it sank. One of the main things that draws me to a film it its score, or sometimes a lack there of. Sappy romantic themes and an unfitting climax music as thousands drown. It just was distracting and honestly didn't belong there. Overall, ""Titanic"" is worth seeing and all, but far from being the best movie ever, or even close for that matter. This a movie where I definitely rent the DVD, practically fall sleep an hour or so in, then wake up and say ""what the? Still not yet?"", and then just use chapter selection to get to see the climax.",7
138,"I haven't seen this in a very long time. I have always been a fan. Looking back on it now it's not as good as it was then, but still very good. There are a million little dumb things that bother me but they're not real complaints. And maybe this is from seeing the movie so many times. I can tell you exactly where the first VHS cut off.The only real complaint I have is the modern day scenes, this whole story line doesn't need to be there. This is a long movie already and about a half an hour goes into this story that ultimately doesn't matter at all. I found myself not giving a crap about these scenes and just waiting to go onto the ship. And then when they come back saying, ""Oh yeah."" And not caring.And this story line really doesn't mean anything because she has the diamond the whole time and doesn't tell them, for some reason, throws it into the water, for some reason and then dies I'm assuming, for some reason. So having Rose tell the story in modern times doesn't amount to anything. The only thing about showing Rose older is to show that she lived a good life like Jack wanted but they don't really go onto that all that much.The best thing this movie does is make you feel for the people who were actually on the ship and do justice to what they went through. And does a really good job of including real people without making anyone look bad. You even see where the people who made bad decisions were coming from.",8
139,"Stuff happens sometimes, boy it does. A couple of underweight's (thin bodies) are able to fall out of the goolish real world. Keep in mind (your're listening to someone that acts like their inside of a coffin all the time). So when I watched this movie someone asked me: hey, why are you staring at the floor? As the person petted someone hair. But what they didn't know is that when rose and jack separated, I did want to convey it somehow. Meanwhile the man in front of me screams like a child and someone had their hand on the back of his neck.",10
140,"This classic is not only about the grandest ship that ever existed, but also about the heart and souls that the short lived Titanic carried with it. Hopes, dreams and aspirations were envisioned by its passengers when they boarded for New York. The attention to detail is seen throughout this film. When the ship sailed, I felt that I boarded along with it. Jack and Rose shared a genuine love that even though it lasted only a few days, it felt like a lifetime. Until the moment it hits the iceberg, the emotions and the agony is felt. The sadness and sorrow was shown in such a profound way. The ending was very sad; however, as the dream sequence ended the film, Titanic will forever live on and its passengers too. A great and authentic film.",10
141,"Great movie, realistic story with some drama, a lot of cry in this movie.
Leonardo DiCaprio was great",8
142,"It's really unfortunate when you see a movie as big and good as the Titanic and not in the top 250, while some of the other movies are weaker than this movie on this list, and that's not good. 10/10",10
143,"I absolutely like this movie! It is the best romantic drama, fantastic direct, gripping music, very good actors, beautiful story... great combination that predestines good results. The film stars Kate Winslet (Rose DeWitt Bukater) and Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson).
The story is about young lover were so different world. Rose is very rich girl. She is engagement with rich man- Caledon Hockley. Rose is unhappy, she must leave to New York to she could get married in NYC. They travel in upper-class with her mother Ruth. Jack and his friend Fabrizio win third-class tickets to the ship in a game. Rose want kill herself. Jack- poore boy and painter save her before jump from ship. Lovers met and love story started...
This story always inspiring me and I often thinking about this film, this story. About lifes a thousand people, about ,,Ship of dream""
My opinion is that life is too short and we must enjoy every moment with people that we loved. Titanic is about this.
You will certainly give me the truth when I write that Titanic is very moving.
For the end ,,A woman´s heart is a deep ocean of secrets.´´",10
144,"Remember the world's most heartbreaking moment, the sinking of the Titanic? Well, memories come back to us when the incredible James Cameron and his big imagination create a powerful love story disaster. The film is a fictional love story, taking place in a historical event. Set to the sinking of the Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio plays a poor man named Jack, who falls in love with a rich woman named Rose, portrayed by Kate Winslet. Although separated by the number of money in their pockets, that does not stop the love between each other. Then, when Titanic begins to sink, sacrifices are being made, and Jack would do anything in his power to make Rose safe. James Cameron let out his heart into this movie, and really wanted to express his feelings on the sinking. Though the film is sad, and maybe too graphic, the film was a beautiful masterpiece portrayed by an amazing cast, a great direction, an amazing re-creation of history, brilliant costumes, breathtaking art direction, scene-stealing sound effects, visionary film editing, and exhilarating visual effects. I watch the movie over and over again and never got tired of enjoying it, cause it will never leave your heart. I'll never forget watching this movie, and I'll respect that it won the Best Picture on my birth year, and glad it made a billion dollars in the box office. This movie will always be epic and romantic in every way. This is a visual marvel, but it also has great characters and a terrific story to go along with it. ""Titanic"", in my review, ""a beautiful masterpiece of the heart, something to enjoy watching over and over.""Oh, and speaking of the 3D re-release, it's worth your money! Even if this movie was made in 1997, James Cameron is one of those filmmakers that knows how to make perfect use of the 3-D, and he makes it look like the movie was made in 3-D. Even if you wish that James Cameron should have cut the film 20 minutes shorter, you still believe that every single detail that James Cameron added, had to be there in the movie. The 3-D literally draws you into the adventure, frankly because this is the type of 3-D that is used perfectly, just like in ""Avatar"". So, go out and watch it again in the special 3-D treatment!",10
145,This is a good movie! Highly recommend watching this with your wife or husband! This is a true romantic iconic movie!,10
146,"I saw a dismal film ahead, when I first saw the opening credits, but it was still entertaining, and a little tragic.  In the typical James Cameron style, this film is just crawling with stuff you wouldn't believe.  The movie starts out dull, with Gloria Stuart helping to pad out the first ten minutes, but then it really gets rolling!  Afterwards, I had to ask myself: Hey, got a cigarette?  I felt spent, and that's typical of Cameron movies too.  If Cameron made a biblical film, I bet he'd have a twenty minute crucifixion scene.  The sinking was incredible, and they saved the best for last; the rest is just another day on board a Loveboat style rip-off.  Oh well, Cameron's not much without his special effects here, but that's what everyone who goes to see this movie already knows.  James Cameron should stop giving himself Orson Welles injections, and just stick to making action movies.  I just keep thinking of those slick effects in his other films, and how beautiful they all were.  This movie?  I guess James was just trying to display some emotion, but it was corny.  The sinking is what this movie's about. Rating: 7/10 (Bill Paxton must have been depressed about his part in the movie)",
147,"Watching 'Titanic' was like having 2 people wrestle with a remote channel changer. Just when the movie becomes (historically) interesting, the other person grabs the remote and switches it to a pedestrian daytime soap opera. Did Kate have to be on hand at every step that led to the sinking? (her and Leo are on the side of the deck where the ice hits, of course, JUST missing them; OH! let's put her next to the Captain when he learns Titanic's fate and lack of life boats). The tragedy was story enough and James Cameron did a brilliant business decision to shove a pre-teen love opera to the foreground so girls could flock to the theater over and over to see Leo alive again and again and again...! Give the channel changer back so we can please continue with the story of the ship. Yes, I heard some crying when Leo sank into the abyss...But no sniveling when the little boy (who Leo tries to rescue before the boy is grabbed away from his panicky father) is swept away by the flooded corridor. So much for crying priorities!!I'm a big Cameron fan! Titanic has left him permanently wealthy. And he's tapped into a genre the same way Lucas tapped with Star Wars in attracting a select category of people that were willing to see this over and over (Titanic's billion dollar revenue was the result of many repeat viewings worldwide combining history with poster boy imagery).Special effects were brilliant! But I'll take the 1958 black and white ""A Night To Remember"" movie instead.Today's lesson: If you're going to use an ax to free someone shackled with chains, don't aim, close your eyes tight, THEN swing hard so you won't see the spraying blood. This is life and death...better leave it to luck!7 out of 10",7
148,"Titanic is a film I wish I had seen in a theater because of its epic scope. Unfortunately, I was a young, dumb teenage boy in 1997, and the movie was premised to me by all the other young, dumb teenage boys as a chick flick. Worse, everyone knows the ending! Ah, to be young, stupid, and crass.Now, at 40, having lived some of life and experienced love and loss, I can think of few films that do a better job of capturing the joy of the former, and the pain of the latter. The titanic itself is merely the stage of the story, and while James Cameron's portrayal of it is expertly done, it is the story here that really shines. Like much of Cameron's work, there is little that is truly original about the story- it is a pretty standard tale of lost love, with themes that echo to all such stories through history. However, what Cameron, Di Caprio, and most of all Winslet pull off here, is marvelous in its execution.Watching this in 2022, I marveled at two things that feel most poignant now. First, this is a deeply feeling film, which clashes strongly with today's cynicism. Indeed, cynicism here is almost the main villain (alongside hubris and classism, of course). Rose is trapped in a world of cynicism, and Jack rescues her from it and helps her to reconnect with her true self. It's beautiful to watch, and the payoff is Rose's story afterward. Even Brock, who is only searching for the titanic in order to find the jewels and become rich, is turned away from cynicism by this story.Second is the protrayal of what I will call 'enthusiastic consent'. In today's world of MeToo and No means No, a distressing number of movies portray acts of love from a predatory male perspective. These portrayals reinforce bad male behaviours, and make it especially difficult for young inexperienced men to act appropriately and recognize a woman's degree of interest in them. The relationship Rose and Jack share, by contrast, does an admirable job of displaying enthusiastic consent. Jack is patient, understanding, empathetic, and above all a very good listener. He makes the first moves of the relationship, but does so gently, without expectation (in stark contrast to Billy Zane's character). Rose then initiates all of the more physical/sexual interactions. There is never any confusion about intent, because their communication, both verbal and otherwise, is so good. It is incredibly sensual. Likewise, there is never any real conflict between Jack and Rose, and the one instance it is tried to (clumsily) be inserted with the accusation of theft, Rose dismisses it rapidly. A lesser film would include some sort of conflict to cause 'drama' between the leads, but Titanic does not. This is a model of what a healthy relationship should look like, and I find it refreshing in this day and age.",10
149,"The fact that this movie won an Oscar for Best Film is one of the biggest disgraces of all time (it ranks right up there with Madonna not getting nominated for her role in Evita).  Everyone loved this thing for some reason, but I found it lame and boring.  I was so glad when the end credits came that I almost burst into hysteric joy!",1
150,"For weeks after seeing the film, whenever I heard on the radio the flute introduction to ""My Heart Will Go On"" (Celine Dion), I became teary-eyed! So, I guess I am a sentimentalist! I think James Cameron delivered a unique, technically-brilliant period piece that could touch the heart, and inform audiences about some significant features of a long-forgotten era.For one, this time period was marked by severe class distinction. I believe that, in 1900, 1% of the USA population controlled 99% of the wealth. Britain, of course, had always been a society where the privileged were noted by everything from their manner of dress, hat style, speech patterns, and clubs where they drank. The film shows the severe gap between the wealthy first-class passengers, and those in 'steerage' where Jack was lodged. Some have argued that poor Jack would never have gotten near Rose a second time. But remember: Rose is a rebel. There's the basis for the relationship. And what better way to illustrate the snobbery of class distinction than by having Jack sit down to dinner with the crusty industrialists? Also, many on the Titanic were on their way to the 'new world' for great opportunities. They had a great struggle (note the passengers who could neither read nor write English?), but they came anyway to escape the oppression of cruel power struggles in Europe.The sheer folly - and tragedy - of piling through iceberg-infested waters in a large, awkward vessel is explained and demonstrated very clearly (in case anyone is still trying to figure it out!).This film is on my IMDb Top-20 .. http://www.imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=8401903 (yikes-I realized I better get busy and finally write a review!), but I will admit that some shortfalls in screenplay prevent it from usurping 'Citizen Kane', 'Amadeus' or Sir David Lean's entries as a true cinematic masterpiece. Note that I said screenplay - not acting, for actors can only deliver the lines on the page. I have always loved PART-1 much more than PART-2. I think that has to do with the 'mix' and 'editing', particularly involving the final scene with Jack and Rose. A few snips here and there would have reduced the melodramatic element. Overall, a little less of the love story, and more development of some other characters would have elevated the presentation. My take is that the screenplay 'missed' - but not by much. The result was a brilliant piece of cinematography that could not field any major players as viable candidates for Oscars in acting.Having said that, there is so much to recommend this fine film. I was very moved by the way Cameron had his Titanic cast assemble for a sort of curtain-call within the movie - haven't seen that before, very unique and effective.9/10 - canuckteach (--:",9
151,"I liked ""Titanic"". Its a good old fashioned adventure/romance/epic with a strong storyline and definable characters. Sure the tacked on romance is as stock as the characters, but that is still better than the alternative served up by most modern movies: ie--no plot and no characterization at all. The thing that bothers me about this version of the Titanic sinking is that writer/director Cameron takes full credit for the screenplay, when so much of it was directly lifted from a 1958 film about the event, ""A Night to Remember"" (also a book, and a previous film). And I'm not talking about the fact the Titanic sunk, or any of the other factual details of the story--obviously those will be the same. I'm talking about virtually identical scenes, events, and dialogue that could not be gathered from public record. Scenes such as the ship's builder standing alone in the tilted ballroom, looking at the painting on the wall as the ship goes down. Or the rich ship corporation a**hole being told that yes, his ship is going to sink, no matter what he says. Or identical scenes of the steerage rabble breaking through the gates. These scenes, and many others, are mounted and shot in so similar a fashion to the previous film, with such similar dialog, that I believe they cross the border into plagerism. Rent the 1958 version of ""A Night to Remember"", watch it, and tell me I'm wrong.",
152,"Titanic is a 1997 American epic romance and disaster film directed, written, co-produced, and co-edited by James Cameron. Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, the film is based on accounts of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage.Titanic truly is the greatest film I've ever seen. The boat had a life of its own and as does the film. What can be said about the film that hasn't already been said? An absolute classic.",10
153,"This film is so full of absurdities and clichés that it is to all the previous Titanic films what ""Airplane"" is to the ""Airport"" saga and ""Blazing Saddles"" is to the Western genre. The unhappy high society girl goes down to third-class deck although it is out of bounds for her. She wants to jump overboard, but she is stopped by a happy-go-lucky nobody with no future and with nothing to his name but the clothes he is wearing on. As a reward he is invited by Hockley to dine fist-class with the jet-set so they can make fun of his lack of education and manners. But he gets along without making too much of a fool of himself, and charms everyone around the table but stiff Hockley and Rose's toff horrid mother. But bored to death from so many starched collars, small talk and no being able to scratch his bum,belch or pick his nose, Jack eventually sneaks away with Rose to a merry party down in third-class where one can swear, spit, get plastered on cheap beer, belch, fart and throw up until they fall flat on their faces. The next day a self-confident and jolly Jack enters the out-of-bounds territory of first class again looking for Rose, greets Mr Andrews like and old mate and trots along without being bothered at all. Although he sticks out like a sore thumb no one seems to notice him. Feel yourself at home, laddie, just don't take a leak in the flower vases, that's all. He is only stopped when he tries to disrupt a solemn religious service. That is the only one thing that cannot be tolerated by any means. Randy Rose asks Jack to draw her naked, and he does so while maintaining his coolness and concentrating seriously on his work as she lies there displaying all her jewels. But instead of banging her in the luxurious comfort of her private chamber they go down to the hull???... Meanwhile Hockley the Wally finally realises that his girl is bending over for that miserable third-class gutter rat, and boy, that drives him bananas. Then the ship bumps into an iceberg because the two idiotic sailors on watch duty are far more interested on the antics of the two horny kids rather than on doing the job they are being paid for in the first place. Here we go then: the unsinkable Titanic commences to sink and the movie finally takes off after 90 minutes of utter boredom. Mr Andrews rushes to the officers' room to deliver his diagnosis, and now there comes the most hilarious scene in the film. As Andrews states that the ship is already dead, company president Ismail almost has an apoplexy. You see his face, with his eyes almost popping out, his choking cry of ""But that is impossible! This ship cannot sink!!"" He is babbling in disbelief, his blood pressure rocketing up to the verge of a coronary, spit flying out of his mouth And Andrews turns to him -you can almost see his eyes rolling ""I built her, sir. She's made of iron. It can sink, and I assure you it will"" And that shuts Ismail up for good. So, now they've got just two hours to get out of there. First-class people go first, of course, since they are the ones who paid more for being here in the first place. Second-class will go after if still there is time. As to third-class well, we just learn now that the lifeboats have a full capacity for only half of the people on board, 700 of which are third-class rubble. Well, officers, you know the procedures: women and children first, and no paupers jumping the queue or you'll be fired. And then, if there is still time and a few empty places left, well just chuck a few ragamuffins into the boats and then save yourselves. And good luck. A third-class ticket for the Titanic did cost the equivalent to 1,500 euros in today's money, and a first-class cost 115,000. So you were treated accordingly to what you paid for, as simple as that. Although time is running out Hockley keeps his hair on, confident that he will buy his way out with a thick wad of notes in the last minute, but meanwhile he is about to play his last villainy: accusing poor old Jack of stealing the mother of all diamonds, and to do that he relies on the faithful assistance of his devoted butler. Nasty Lovejoy frames Jack and has him handcuffed deep below so that he will drown quicker. But stubborn Rose, in an almost superhuman feat that will have feminist radicals raving, sets him free, they get back to deck and try to board a boat. The outraged Hockley, now on the verge of an apoplexy,chases them with a gun in a comical sequence that culminates with another ridiculous line ""I put the diamond in the coat and I put the coat on her!"" The ship finally sinks into history, but the pair of randy doves manage to stay afloat. Now, the water is freezing and no one can survive in it for more than half an hour at the most. Yet Jack seems to last for hours long after everyone else floating around have succumbed to hypothermia. But eventually he dies too, because the story was meant to be a tearjerker in the first place. Miraculously enough, Rose, despite wearing her soaking clothes on all night, survives without even getting a cough (!!!)",3
154,"What I think I'll probably like best about the new Star Wars film, ""Phantom Menace"", is that it will likely blow ""Titanic"" out of the water, if you'll pardon the pun, when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts, and thereby knock it out of the number one spot. Every time I hear someone declare ""Titanic"" is the greatest film they've ever seen, I think to myself, ""You don't see a lot of movies, do you?"" What a travesty. You could make 50 good films that are a lot better than ""Titanic"", and for the same price tag.""Well, it won lots of academy awards, lots of people really loved it,"" as someone might say in its defence. Well, lots of people like the Spice Girls and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald's, but that doesn't mean it's high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans CAN be wrong.I'll be the first to admit, that part of the problem for me was the mega-hype over the film. I waited a month or so to see it and ultimately, it didn't live up to the expectations set upon it, which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story. It's true, ""Phantom Menace"" will likely suffer a similar fate. but.James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is. a)  a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece. b)  a three-hour epic that has it's finest moments given away in the trailer. c)  a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment. d)  something left better to documentarians, which I would've enjoyed much more. e)  a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship. f)  a  robbery of 3 hours that I will never get back, therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine I can think of. When I meet someone who hasn't seen it yet, I say, ""I wish I could trade places with you."" g)  a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia. How long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences? h)  thankfully a film that wasn't recognized for any acting achievements at the Oscars. i)  a technological achievement in filmmaking, and little else.The only reason I post this as a anonymous comment is I do NOT welcome the rebuttal of 10,000 thirteen year old Leonardo DiCaprio fans who'll no doubt come to his defense, and I am not really interested in hearing a defense of Titanic's story, acting or length.",1
155,"Anyone who has even a glimmer of an idea of language, thought, or customs of turn-of-the-century US/Britain would be repelled by this film.  I've read a number of survivor accounts, and people just didn't THINK or TALK the way they thought and spoke in the film.  Anachronisms aside, it was, I suppose, only a love story.  But there are so many better ones that have been filmed. Titanic was to me a real disappointment.",1
156,My review is 10 star for this titanic movie best direction of James Cameron movie,10
157,"The movie is a total perfection. When it appeared back in 1997 and i watched for the first time it leaved an influence on me what no other movie had. Maybe The Lord Of The Rings ,maybe not :), that movie is another greatness of the film-making.Coming back too Titanic with the record $1,835,300,000 Worldwide Box Office that is still no.1 after 11 years is amazingly great.I cannot understand the users of IMDb because this movie is not in the top 250 movies . That is shame ,this movie it is at least in the top 5 greatest movies ever not too mention in the top 250. A movie at least 8-9 out of 10 ,IMDB USERS!!! Wake Up and see the movie again because you seen something else. I cannot find another top with movies somewhere else where Titanic is not included.The movies prior theme beside the ship's history is the greatest human feeling: love what is universal and timeless. The picture presents us the meaning of true love. Our main characters Jack the poor artist and Rose the rich girl from the first class made us all cry even if we willing too recognize or not.Inn all lines the movie makes us think if we can go further after loosing the the most precious person in our life. We'll we can go on because life must goo on but it will remain in our hearts forever.With no doubt this is the best movie directed by James Cameron, among his other great achievements. James Horner's soundtrack is simply beautiful and completely matches with the movie ,there is no surprise that his soundtrack album has been sold with 30 million copy'sThe movie is the greatest achievement in cinema ,it is the top of the pyramid...",10

159,"Just outside Kursk on a sunny July morning in 1943 Obersturmführer Muller of the 3rd Panzer Division has a problem. His fancy new Panther tank, in a Meisterstück of environmentally sound engineering, has come with a two live zebra painfully welded to the rear and, as we know, Germans don't do back wheel drive. Vorsprung Durk Technic.A similar, and no less surreal, problem plagues James Cameron's technical tour de force. It is impressive, groundbreaking and sophisticated but, let's face it, it's going nowhere with a plot like that bolted incongruously to its chassis.Renowned to be one of the most expensive films of all time; it seems preposterous that a few quid couldn't have been siphoned from the ""huge-ship-sinks-dramatically"" budget into the ""story"" budget. But there you go.The actors try their best. Plaudits go Leonardo DiCaprio for successfully rehashing Hollywood's cheesy Iorish stereotypes. Billy Zane is excellent as the ""creepy, violent one"". And, of course, our Kate furthers the plot significantly by putting her famous waps on display (they are very impressive).In fact the plot is so bad, and the dialogue so awful, you can sense the huge directorial sigh of relief when the ship starts to sink. Listen carefully and you can almost hear Cameron mutter over tortured screech of ice on metal, ""Ah! This is the kinda film I understand."" Once the ship goes belly-up things do, indeed, liven up dramatically. Things slide around, people scream, chandeliers crash, vast imponderable drops open beneath peoples' legs and the huge, hulking edifice that is James Cameron's Titanic sinks gracefully and inexorably into the dark waters.At least an hour and forty minutes before all this, Winslet provides one of the more amusing, unintentional ironies of the film, when she declares to the ship's designer ""Mr Freud has some interesting theories about men forever striving to make things bigger"". Biggest ship, biggest movie, biggest budget. Hmmm, save it for Oprah.So impressive, expensive, huge and groundbreaking. Nevertheless, Titanic remains a towering cathedral to mediocrity - and the only film for which the best viewing experience is achieved by arriving two-and-a-half hours late and leaving ten minutes before the end. 4/10.",4
160,"This Hollywood tour de force is too mainstream for its own good. Great visuals, expensive sets, great hype, but ultimately shallow, it perhaps does not deserve all the hate if often gets, but by all means it did not deserve the hype with which it was initially met. So, in reality, a mixed bag. Hollywood has produced much worse and also had its honor pieces. This moneymaker is neither of the extremes, but it is certainly too soulless manipulative and shallow to be considered a master piece, but when stripped off its dumbest pandering it has some decent side to it, mainly of the technical nature.",4
161,"TITANIC is actually two films. The first film is a very unlikely love story so syrupy it can cause diabetes. Then it suddenly mutates into a James Bond film where - wait for this - Bond is played by Kate Winslet. Maybe this isn't entirely accurate because James is total fantasy , but never becomes as unbelievable as this. Oh and at least in a Bond film the Brits are the good guys unlike here where they are invaribly cruel , stupid and/or cowardly. Also at no point in a Bond film does a script change the laws of physics where it's possible for someone to escape from the undercurrants of a ship weighing thousands of tons. Oh and the special effects are better in Bond films , TITANIC's are not entirely convincing.But the most fantastic thing about TITANIC isn't the fact it made so much money at the box office ( This is explained by 14 year old girls lining up at the cinema to watch Leonardo for the 25th time ) but the fact this film won 11 ( Yes Eleven.You read that right ) Oscars, equalling the total held by BEN HUR. What the hell were the Academy thinking ? I know they didn't give any awards for the quality of the acting or even nominated the screenplay for an Oscar ( They got that right . Boy did they get that right ) but for it to win 11 Oscars including Best Picture ( Didn't any of the voters watch LA CONFIDENTIAL ? ) really upset me because films like GONE WITH THE WIND , etc didn't get that many",4
162,"SPOILERS INCLUDED...Although I made a vow to myself to NEVER see this movie, my girlfriend begged me to rent it and sit through it with her.  So, very reluctantly, I did.  And let me just say, Titanic was everything I expected.  Titanic is nothing but an overly sappy, unrealistic, historically incorrect, drawn out, trashy film.  With all the hype this film received, after seeing it I expected to see Titanic on IMDB's Top 250 list...but it's not!  WHEW!! Good, because it doesn't deserve to be.  My God, WHAT WAS THE HYPE ABOUT?? Why was this movie 3 hours and 14 minutes?  That alone is a BIG flaw of this film because we all know what's going to happen in the end.... why let the audience wait 2.5 hours to see the inevitable?  This movie could've been cropped to 2.5 easily...which still maybe would've been too long.  The corny love story was just horrible.  The language used, especially by DiCaprio's character, was totally unbelievable and unconvincing....we're supposed to be in 1912, remember??  Kate Winslet came off as an annoying little brat....DiCaprio was barely tolerable.  Another thing that turned me off to the film was the story.  How could people embrace this film so much in its account of the Titanic experience... and the story is fictional?  We're supposed to take Cameron's word for it? Please!  The love story, along with the overall script he wrote was SICKENING.  The only good part of the film is when the boat starts to sink....that's the only part of the film that really matters.   
Now my major gripe with the film:  What was the deal with Rose taking up the whole door???  LOL.  Did you all see how big that door was???  You mean to tell me that Jack couldn't fit on the door with her?  She claimed she loved Jack...even went back to save him while he was chained to the pipe in that room that was flooding.  If that was the case why couldn't she make room for him to get up on the door with her instead of freezing to death in the Atlantic?? I'm curious whether anyone else has wondered that....The scene i mentioned above embodies my feelings about Titanic.  It seems Cameron just wanted to get some Oscars, so he put the formula together to do so.  Get Celine Dion to sing da song, the sappy score, put Leo in there so all da little girls would go see it and feel sorry for him, have a HUGE budget, use lots of CGI and make it a 3+ hour film (so it could be an epic of course).  it all comes across as CHEAP!  He was trying too hard to appeal to everyone...it has the sappy emotional, 'boo-hoo' aspect for the ladies and the graphic action-packed death sequences for the guys.  In the end we have 3 hours of confusion and essentially pointless narrative.  I finally sat through this film and, like I knew it would, it justified my initial thoughts of it when it first released in '97.  Corny, horrible story, and completely overdone.  Bottom line, this movie sucked, and has to be the most overrated film I've seen in a LONG, long time, maybe ever.  *1/2 out of ****.",4
163,Outstanding movie!!! It could've been longer with all the deleted scenes but 3 hours and 15 minutes was enough. The acting was good! Most of James Cameron's movies are good. This is one of them!!,9
164,"Titanic is 3 hours long yet managed to keep me captivated the entire time. You can clearly see the effort put into this masterpiece. Basically everything about the film is amazing: the visuals, the characters and the story in general. I love how the story cut between the past and the present. The actresses of both old and young Rose are amazing. Practically all of the actors put on a dazzling performance, even the extras. The first part of the film for the most part generates positive feelings, even though you know what's going to happen. The part where the ship sinks creates powerful emotions, as the film really involves you and makes you feel like you were a part of it. The film also makes you become attached to the characters. These scenes are deeply upsetting, and this film is the only film that I have cried during due to how realistic it is and that the fact that you know this really happened. Overall, this film is beautifully done and is fully deserving of all the high praise it has gained. It makes you feel all kinds of emotions and is definitely a film of the ages.",10
165,"Titanic {dir. James Cameron, 1997} (*½/****)Somewhere on its way to becoming the all time box office champion and biggest Oscar winner of all time, James Cameron's Titanic etched out a place in my mind as the one film that can most easily send me into a frenzied rant against the dangers of big- budget, epic film making. Sure, I might not have put it that way when I first saw it (I was seven) but, upon first viewing I knew that this film was nothing special. Four years later, I was able to identify it as simply money thrown onto the screen with little room left for intelligence, emotion or character. Yet even as I professed the evils of this production and its vapid screenplay (penned by director Cameron), there were those who maintained that Titanic was an achievement. Among those people are esteemed film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert , both of whom included it on their top ten lists of 1997. Those celebratory citations led me to revisit Titanic again recently, for the first time on DVD, a disc which preserves the film's original aspect ratio and presents the clearest available picture and sound. The Verdict: As the old truism goes, ""You can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig.""The film isn't all bad; the cast is solid (considering the material..but more on that later), the score is rich, the cinematography is evocative and the production design and visual effects are impeccable. Yet as it turns out, all these elements do not a great film make. Titanic's greatest weakness lies at its very core: the screenplay. It reaches a level so wretched that I will be blunt in my metaphoric criticism. Cameron's script isn't just a turd, it is a floater; it refuses to just be flushed away to haunt us no longer. It insists on having an epic length and employing a framing device that may very well be the cause of a sudden onset of narcolepsy. I'm sorry to resort to such infantile comparison, but I believe that is best to convey the utter insult that is Cameron's screenplay. I consider myself a romantic, yet the so-called romance of this film left me cold, with nothing to do except roll my eyes. The film lacks any new vision or originality, and that can never be commended. I'm fed up at this point; three viewing, each one revealing an un-plundered area of Cameron's incompetence. This film remains an interminable, and wildly popular, mash of tired formula only be idolized by starry eyed tweens.",5
166,"The work done off screen was completely worth it. I suggest you check the trivia of the movie to understand that this movie deserves all the Oscars it got and more. It is a timeless movie, with strong acting. I've heard people complain bout the acting of the main actors, but without strong acting the movie would have never succeeded as much as it did. Leonardo DiCaprio was born for the role of Jack Dawson, he makes the audience fall in love with him rapidly, and not just because of his looks. Kate Winslet represents well the role of a young girl in need of freedom. Everything about the movie was outstanding. The setting is a very similar replica too the actual RMS Titanic. It is very realistic since several characters did in fact exist. The special effect are great, seeing in 3D must be quite the experience. The music, My Heart Will Go On, also one of my favorite songs. I don't believe there is anything bad to say other than ""Why did Jack have to die? couldn't they write a happy ending? why make people sad when you have the power to make them cry of joy instead? I love you Jack! Rose don't let go of Jack!"" Once you overcome the extreme feeling of sadness and anger because Jack was too nice and died, you realize that the movie is amazing. PERFECT in every sense of the word.",10
167,"I just went into the movie theatre to see my all time favourite movie, Titanic by James Cameron, in all its brilliance.It's just like those 15 years have never happened. It's so utterly sweeping to watch this huge vessel rising up in the screen. Cameron outstandingly managed to shoot his sequences comparing sizes against each other which - by their contrast - brings so much emotion to something we only perceive in real life: size.After watching the movie, I can't believe this is a 2D to 3D conversion. This is not just a diorama kind of 3D conversion; watching the movie it's hard to believe it was not shot in 3D originally. Even in real life action scenes Cameron stems the task of creating realistic 3D perspective throughout the movie. It must have been hell to mesh all the fringes in each and every of the frames. Well, as I learned now, it took 60 weeks and 18 Million dollars to work on this. That gamble payed off very well.Not to mention all the emotion that comes with the story. Cameron is a wizard of timing. One moment the audience is just deeply moved by romance, when it gets torn out right the next moment by fear, anger or laugh.This is a very emotional film. There are so many different fates one can as easily think his/her way into. In 1997 I have been crying about what I saw in a movie - I was baffled, because this happened for the first time in my life... Now in 2012 I was crying, laughing, fearing so much all the way again, together with my girl friend.We personally feel so much like Rose and Jack. There are so many details in the movie that match our situation, up to tiny things like dancing barefoot or the butterfly as a symbol for freedom at heart and escape from family's restrictions.To all those who don't like the movie, here's my advice: NEVER watch this film on TV! You can only appreciate this precious work of art in a movie theatre. - I never saw this movie on TV and I never will. But when it'll come back to the theatre's in a couple of years, I'll be right back to watch it there.",10
168,"This is going to be a short review for Titanic.Plot: The plot of the film is really amazing. If you want a three-hour long love story, this is the movie for you. Another movie worth watching is ""A Walk to Remember"", starring Mandy Moore and it is a movie that I have seen and it is spectacular. The entire 196-minute picture centers around two lovers: one rich girl named Rose DeWitt Bukater and poor artist Jack Dawson (portrayed nicely by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio) as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during it's ill-fated maiden voyage.Characters and Story: James Cameron wrote a story that shines out, but the dialogue is very clichéd and cheesy in a few areas. The characters are all well portrayed and I give to the two main actors, also credit to Billy Zane, who plays Cal, he is the character you want to hate. Kathy Bates, Bernard Hill, Frances Fisher, Johnathan Hyde, Danny Nucci, David Warner, Bill Paxton and the late Gloria Stuart, who plays older Rose in this film and she should have deserved an Oscar.Visuals: This is where the movie shines. James Cameron wanted to make a movie about the Titanic and it shows, with it's $200 million dollar budget and he made this movie historically accurate as possible. The ship's sinking scene is one of the coolest thing they could do with CGI and practical effects and it is awesome.Sound / Music: The music is awesome and fantastic. James Horner composed a musical score and he is fantastic. The film's theme song, ""My Heart Will Go On"", performed by Celine Dion and I love it and a lot of people has did covers of this song and I listen to this version and it was fantastic.Enjoyment: TITANIC is a good classic, epic romantic disaster film that I have no problem watching once in a while. The film won 11 Oscars including Best Director, Best Picture and Best Original Song. It made $2 billion dollars worldwide and it is just fantastic. 10/10.",10
169,"I really don't know why the rating is low, this is the best film I have ever watched.

170,"One of the well-known ships that became an disaster at sea was the Titanic. It sank in 1912 on its voyage out to sea. Disaster struck when the ship hits an iceberg and cause it to sink. The passengers of the Titanic were trying to survive. Many of them died. Some of them were in lifeboats. Now, James Cameron brings back the mighty ship. In his film Titanic, a man named Jack Dawson, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He goes on the Titanic after winning an poker game. Also on board an beautiful passenger, played by Kate Winslet and her fiancé, played by Billy Zane. DiCaprio and Winslet fall for each other in love as the Titanic ventures out to sea. Then, the iceberg hits the Titanic and that is when chaos begins. Passengers are frightened as the ship slowly starts to sink. The ship's sinking isn't about the passengers screaming and panicking, but it gives an realistic dramatization of the ship. Real documentary footage of the real Titanic appear on the opening credits. Winslet's character Rose, now old, is played by Gloria Stuart, who remembered what happen that night. The movie's visionary of the Titanic sinking is wonderful made with the special effects. As for Winslet and DiCaprio, they have great performances as Rose and Jack. The film itself is a tragedy of what happened. Titanic is one of the best films of 1997. An great, true Hollywood Epic. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10
171,"It's just stupid that says this movie is bad.
Titanic is one of the best films ever made, not even today there is anyone who dares to make a remake because everyone knows that there will never be a film about Titanic better than this one.",10
172,Mills & Boon on a boat. Still love Leonardo though!,4
173,"Yes, it was wildly over-rated, in that respect serving only to inflate Jim cameron's ego.  Yes, it is certainly not the best movie ever made.  Yes, the script was weak, and the acting isn't really too wonderful.  Leonardo DiCaprio has the blandest, most obvious lines I've ever heard, does not act them very well at all, and basically suvrives only on his smile and the fact that everyone knew millions of teenage girls would be swooning.  I didn't understand Billy Zane's character, but he wasn't on very much, so I didn't have to be confused by him a lot.  I do think it's awful that all those girls cried only over ""Leo"" and not over the thousands of people who died, but for those who were watching for another reason, there is still a pretty good movie there, in my opinion.  The scope is amazing, with all the sweeping shots, lavish, mostly accurate details, and spectacular effects. Cameron really orchestartes the mood of every scene wonderfully; though some of it is pretty cheesy, for the most part I really was caught up in it. While the acting isn't spectacular, as I said, some of the people turn in pretty good performances.  Kate Winslet did for the most part, though in the action scenes, where she's given the role of hero, instead of doing something with it she just pants away and screams for Leo and does nothing else.  Otherwise, she handles the acting pretty well.  Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates, the captain, the designer of the ship, and the many third-class passengers were also good.  Even though the movie focused on fictional characters and not on these people, there's enough there to really affect you.  Seeing them being so cruelly and unjustly shut up in steerage and not being allowed to get to the lifeboats is a pretty powerful scene.  And just tell me you weren't in some way moved by the mother singing her kids to sleep, the old couple (who were real) hugging each other in bed, the people getting shot and killed by smokestacks, the captain shutting himself in as the windows break, and the band playing on and on and on.  I mean, come on! This really happened!  It was the most affecting part of the movie for me. I guess it was because I was so affected by it that I felt sad when Leo went under.  All the nay-sayers concentrate on the fiction part, which admittenly isn't up to the standards of these scenes, but also is not the only thing there.  Perhas if people just didn't look at the first part and only at the second part, they'd understand one reason why this movie was so successful. Yes, the teenage girls were a big factor, or so we hear, but plenty of other people went two and three times besides them, and they went because they were so affected by it that they just had to see it again.  Maybe it doesn't deserve to be the most successful movie ever made, but it deserves to be a classic, and undoubtedly will be no matter what anyone says.  Yes, it has flaws, but what movie doesn't?  There's more to this movie besides those flaws, if you just look.",7
174,"James Cameron is one of my favorite filmmakers,but I loathe TITANIC. Of course,how can I argue with all the teenyboppers who turned it into a hit? This movie is worthless,albeit beautiful. It's just so incredibly precalculated and manipulative and annoying.",
175,"The movie opens as researchers try to find out diamonds inside the wreck of the real titanic, which gives us the first full look of the wreck of the unsinkable ship which was a bit emotional. Bill Paxton finds 85 years old diary which hold the drawing of the naked women & then later on it's been telecast on TV. The movie goes into flashback & here comes the glimpse of the beautiful ship titanic. The bunch of characters appear in the movie at the port of Belfast, which also includes the male leading start Leonardo winning the ticket of titanic on the lucky hand of poker. The movie literally gives you the feeling of viewer being inside of the ship & according to the facts everything in the movie is been re-designed from the furniture to the decks, lamps, the door way, life boats, & along with the engine room.The real movie beings after Rose decides to suicide jumping from the rear end of the ship & Jack take her mind off the track & saves her. As the movie continues Jack & Rose starts to meet up regularly at the different parts of the ship, while on the other hand Rose mother & her fiancé Cal doesn't like Rose spending time with lower class standard jack, but still young hearts were attracted to each other. The best scene in the movie according to me is the flying scene of Jack & Rose, which makes rose realize that she is in love with Jack too. The movie takes sudden turns when on the same night titanic hits the iceberg, which in short left my eyes wide open, as it has been directed & executed very well, & then the final chapter of the maiden voyage beings the sinking of the unsinkable titanic. The final hour of the movie filled with reality & the disaster which people till now hasn't forgotten. People struggling to survive & the real history how traveler's were saved into the life boats are the key scenes of the movie. Some true scenes like the Creator of titanic Thomas Andrews died while standing near the dining clock & was last seen, the steamer falling on the jacks brother, third class traveler's were treated during the sinking scenes. The breaking apart of ship are the most shattering scenes in the movie. There is no doubt even today in 2012 still I wonder what James Cameron has achieved in the special effects put into this movie, the year 1997 the worked on their best special effects effort to keep this movie alive even for the upcoming generation to watch on. The soul of the movie is the background score of this motion picture which is composed by James Horner every piece of music is been composed specially to suit the scenes of this movie itself, from the opening sequence to de-porting of titanic to Rose theme & the sinking sequence. James Cameron specially recorded the score of the movie with real orchestra the team of James Horner. In one the interviews of the making of Avatar one of the viewer asked him "" what if you get a chance to direct Titanic again, what would be your experience in making it "" ?? and he answer if I would have been given a change to direct titanic again, I will finish titanic within a month very easily cause of hugely availability of special effects team, cause for titanic I had to wait for some shot for days. For example the shot of Rose & Jack on the front end of the ship kissing each other, he had to wait for days to get proper sunset in the camera as special effects that time weren't that advanced like how they are today. In one word you're a legend Cameron. The wreck shot of ship were taken in the year 1995 2 years before the releasing the movie into theaters. Till now whenever I watch this movie I still feel I'm watching it for the first time & somewhere there are tears in my eyes specially in the scene where rose steps into the life boats & Jacks watches her going away, oh geez that particular scene gets tears in my eyes every time. I am now waiting for the special edition of this movie to be released in 3d blu-ray. True facts about TITANIC Titanic was constructed to be unsinkable ship of that time, but the creator of the ship Thomas made 3 biggest mistakes in constructing the ship. The propeller of the ship were taken directly from the design of the 18's century cruise liner, the water tight compartments had one the major flaws which over flowed the water from the upper decks, the propellers turning radius was not designed to turn ship quickly as the ship size was way bigger than the propellers could bear it during the full stern. On the night of sinking titanic received 5 iceberg warning, but still they ignored the warning & continue sailing. The final decision by the Mr Murdoch to reverse the engines & turning the ship to evade iceberg. The decision not to carry enough life boats cause it ruins the overall look of the top deck & it was initially decided to carry just 8 life boats, but later on more 12 boats were added. The distress call from titanic was actually received by the local streamer waiting for the morning to sail again couldn't reach for help as the streamer couldn't see the titanic as the sky was full of twinkling stars which interrupted the them to see through binoculars.The crew lost their binoculars on the night ship hitted the iceberg.My rating – 10/10 !!!!!!!",10
176,Such a masterful film with great performances by winslet and di caprio. He definitely deserved an Oscar for this one. A film based on a real life tragedy,9
177,"This film and the adoration it has received from viewers and reviewers alike is one of the dominant reasons why I have decided not to attend any American made films this year. My reasons are too numerous and strongly felt to be reduced to 1,000 words. I think that this picture itself can take the place of my 1,000 words of disgust with James Cameron and the American film industry.",7
178,"One of the saddest and most tragic stories, frightening when it comes to the disaster in a certain way. One of the most important films in Cinema history so definitely a must watch and 10/10.",10
179,"Rarely does a story so well known by viewers surprise them so wonderfully. Everyone knows about the Titanic and the travesty that transpired, but people often forget about the lives of those involved and the experiences they endured. The story of the Titanic, the infamous ship, and two starstruck lovers, who were merely forgotten, displays vast beauty in an otherwise unfortunate event. From the characters to scenery, this movie captivates the audience with its enthralling imagery and emotional acting. Stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet perform incredibly in their respective roles, and demonstrate that going against the status quo is not necessarily bad. Throughout the film, viewers are taken on a journey. One that begins with Rose happily accepting Jack into her life, and then Jack tirelessly trying to stay in it. To say Titanic is a romance is an understatement. It possesses action, adventure, drama and all the like, and is far from your generic love movie. I was gladly surprised by how much I loved this film even after seeing its numerous awards and superb reviews. Titanic is a movie that will certainly not disappoint, and it is definitely one for the ages that I recommend for anyone and everyone to see.",9
180,"Titanic is one of my favorite movies, and it is a timeless classic that did not receive the acclaim and respect it deserved. I know that it got Oscar nominations, and it received the hype, but its not even in the top 250 which is very disappointing, because Titanic is as least as good if not better than many of the movies in the top 250. It is unfortunate that it was unpopular among so many people. During its day it was the highest grossing film of all time. Unfortunately the success and hype of the movie have spawned vicious criticism. A lot of viewers love Titanic, but many more bash the film and dissect it for problems such as its ""lack of originality"", ""weak script"", and ""poor acting"", all of which are overly critical and not true. Maybe the script could have been a little better, but it was good enough for me. It may have been simple, but it was still well-written in my opinion. I don't know why everyone say's the acting is bad, I thought all of the cast did very well in this movie. As for the originality, its not the first love story to be told, but in my opinion it is the most believable, epic, and heart-wrenching love story to ever be depicted in a movie. The love the two characters have for each other is totally convincing.Titanic does use a historical setting to set the foundation for the movie, but so do a lot of other great movies. A lot of people say they don't like Titanic because it was too long, but I don't think the movie's length is a problem because it's so good that it's worth the 3 hour commitment. Sure, it could have been a little shorter, but I don't know that it would have been made that much of an improvement. Titanic is indeed a very lengthy film, but the movie is breath-taking because of its strong plot, gorgeous cinematography, phenomenal special effects, and superb acting. A lot of people don't like Leonardo Di Caprio in this movie. In fact, many of the people who didn't like this movie blame Di Caprio. Leonardo Di Caprio is not really respected as an actor but often dismissed as a ""pretty boy"". Leonardo Di Caprio is not the greatest actor ever, but he did a good job in this movie, and I find the attacks on his acting to be unfair. In my opinion he did his best work in this movie.Kate Winslet is perfect in Titanic. She is a very gifted actress who is part of what makes this movie so good. But she didn't do it alone: The chemistry between her character and Leonardo Di Caprio's character is so natural, that it does not seem like they acting at all. Kate Winslet plays a young woman from a rich family named Rose, and Leonardo Di Caprio plays a poor artist named Jack. The two meet on the voyage of the Titanic and fall in love. But Rose is strongly encouraged to marry a rich man named Cal Hockley. Rose's family and Cal disapprove of Jack. Throughout the movie Rose and Jack's relationship develops, much to Cal's dismay. Cal becomes the enemy of both Rose and Jack. He hires a man to capture Jack.A real ocean liner was built for the production of this movie. It is not quite as big as the real Titanic but it is close to it. The replica of the ship looks very authentic, it looks just like the real ship. Titanic may start off a little slow, but it is still very engrossing, in my opinion. The second half of the movie is unforgettable. It is tense, suspenseful, and compelling. Watching this movie makes you feel like you were really on the ship. The movie does include some characters that really were on the ship, but Jack and Rose's characters are fictitious. I'm not sure how accurate the rest of the movie is, but the reality of it all is impeccable. Titanic is a riveting movie that really draws you in to the disaster and the tragedy of that night.I would certainly recommend Titanic, to all audiences. Do not listen the hype though, and do not listen to the criticism either. Just watch the movie, and make your own opinion. If you leave your cynicism at the door, then you may just discover the beauty of this movie.",7
181,"The problem director and writer James Cameron faces with a story about the Titanic is that the majority of his audience will know what happens. So to make his audience care, he switches the action and main plot from the ship, to a socially inappropriate love story between Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt Bukater. The trouble is that by incorporating the love story theme into the story, he seems to detract from the feel and humanity that previous Titanic films like A Night to Remember have had. Cameron instead opts for two separate halves to the story rather than melding the two separate elements together. The first half concentrating on building an audience rapour with the two main characters, while the second half concentrates on the special effects fuelled sinking of the doomed liner. This would be forgivable if it weren't for several key factors from the first half, the main weakness being the utterly one dimensional lead characters we are presented with. From Caledon Hockleys loveless millionaire to Rose's trapped innocence to Jack Dawson's poor boy with a dream. Aswell played as these characters are, the performance can't make up for the poorly written characters the actors have been given. Again, with the spectacle of the story of the titanic and the millions of dollars at Cameron's disposal, one could forgive the weakness of the characters, but then the  first half of the story is so entirely cliché ridden and full of predictability that it becomes obvious. It is clear that she will leave her safe life and existence and go with the unpredictability of true love. It is almost as though Cameron knows how to tell this story visually, he's just not sure or not capable of making you care about it. Cameron's writing has always come under scrutiny. The comic book quality of films like True Lies and the Terminator films set the scene for his writing style. The childlike quality of some of the dialogue shouldn't but does stand out. ""Something Picasso"" and Freud, is he a passenger?"" are so dire that they belong in a Farrelly Brothers film, not a $200 million blockbuster. Cameron does seem to be writing from the heart, the trouble is that his heart doesn't seem up to the task. ""It's pay-day boys"" and Dicaprio's now legendary ""I'm the king of the world"" seem not to be spoken by the characters in the film, but by Cameron himself. He is the master film-maker who can resurrect the Titanic and will make a fortune from it.Questions that arise on investigation of the film closely are the gaping plot hole of  Rose's narration and status as the main narrative agent. If the story we see is told from Rose's perspective, how are we granted access to scenes such as the Captain's death and Hockley and Lovejoy hatching the plan to trap Jack? Again, if the story we are being told is not from Rose's perspective and is a general overview of the events, why are we subjected to Rose's story telling voice over? Perhaps this is being overly critical of what is simply meant to be viewed as popcorn entertainment and indeed, the film isn't entirely without its merits. The hour long sinking of the ship is indeed breathtaking and the film does have probably three genuinely special moments. Winslet and Dicaprio's flying scene, the ship breaking in two and Jack's death which is surprisingly touching and moving. The trouble is, especially in a three hour long film, that these few moments don't make up for the other half of the film. In a three hour film, half is ninety minutes, the average length of a Hollywood film, perhaps Cameron should have sacrificed some of the unnecessary moments and concentrated the story into perhaps just over two hours.Cameron's back catalogue of films should prepare us for what we are going to see. The Abyss, True Lies and Terminator 2 : Judgement Day show that as a visionary, he can amaze his audience simply by clicking his fingers. The problem lies with his misplaced attempts to try and bring humanity into his stories. In The Abyss, Cameron wants us to care about the relationship between Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio and Ed Harris. In True Lies, we are asked to care about Schwarzenegger's flagging relationship with his wife Jamie Lee Curtis. Similarly in Titanic, we are asked to ignore the special effects and care about the characters relationship. If Cameron were to write a out and out blockbuster that did not need characters require the audience to care, he would probably create one of the most amazing films ever to be seen. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be what he wants to do.",
182,"There isn't much to say about this film other than incredible. A true epic masterpiece. I admit to seeing it five time in the theater an countless times since then. Once you've seen the film the first time, it's opening scene and music immediately drives you to tears and they don't really stop for the next 3 hours and 14 minutes. As clichéd as the story of jack and Rose may be, a name had to be given to the faces that we lost in this preventable tragedy. And what a powerful love story it is. To have loved so deeply and passionately in such short a time and have it stay with you forever is what everyone wishes for themselves. A lot of flack is given to Cameron's script, and while it could be have been better, it certainly wasn't laughable. Winslet and DiCaprio gave incredible performances with what they were given and this film will truly stand the test of time, due to its powerful gritty nature. It was almost better back in the day when it was split up into two tapes and I would never put the 2nd one in because it was too heartbreaking to sit through. This film is truly a masterpiece. I've seen it a dozen time and ugly cry every time.",10
183,"Not a single thing on thia movie is bad. I repeat not a single thing. I think it's even pointless to give a review about it because every human being loves it. This is even famous and loved to those countries, those people who isn't familiar with English Movies!",10
184,"Titanic (1997): Dir: James Cameron / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton: It became the biggest box office hit at the time indicating an event in history that plays off an interesting premise. A drawing of a woman is discovered within the ruins of the Titanic and after news coverage she appears at one hundred years old to bring reality to the historical tragedy. Director James Cameron showcases exquisite production and art direction at its most seamless and breathtaking just as he did with other big budget hits such as The Terminator and Aliens. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a drifter who steers Kate Winslet away from a potential suicide. She is caught within an arranged engagement where she grows increasingly sick of the lifestyle. They fall in love where he ultimately demonstrates sacrifice while she grows stronger. Predictably her family disapproves of him until they cling to each other during the pointlessly long climax sinking of the ship. DiCaprio and Winslet are basically Romeo and Juliet under different names. Billy Zane is embarrassing as her jealous fiancé who scowls and pursues them with a gun. Kathy Bates makes an appearance as one of the many doomed passengers. Huge achievement for Cameron but the sinking climax is overlong and sometimes corny as bodies hurl to their deaths leaving many hoping they will not sink with it. Score: 5 ½ / 10",5
185,"James Cameron is one of the best directors of all time. I have never seen him make a bad movie. This and his most recent Avatar are in the top ten of my favorite all time films. I know when a movie is very good is when I choke up. I did that for several scenes in this three-hour epic. The wonderful score by James Horner initiated some of those teardrops.This is about the fateful night in mid-April of 1912 when the luxury liner Titanic sank. Also, there is a romance story between a guy from the lower class and a girl from the upper class.The acting is pretty great. Yes there were some cheesy lines but so what. The brilliant performances of Kate and Leo make up for it.I can't see why people blast this movie with their criticisms. Maybe it was successful and it made tons of money.Overall, this is one of the best movie of all times. There's a reason why it won eleven Academy awards. I rate this film 10/10.",10
186,"The tale of the ill-fated, unsinkable, R.M.S. Titanic is a tale we all know too well, but could not have been illustrated more beautifully. James Cameron went above and beyond illuminating this tragedy of the 1940s, paralleling the pain, heartbreak, romance, and anger from the horrific event directly through the film. The two of the strongest performances ever given by DiCaprio and Winslet, that it still remains unforgettable almost 25 years later. The gut wrenchingly beautiful score by James Horner is one of the film's crucial elements, displaying a whole new realm of emotions with every note. This film is deserving of all of its success, and will forever be a classic, timeless, and celebrated masterpiece.",10
187,It's a feeling!There may be people who 'hate😂' this movie. But it doesn't matter because for me it is the best movie!I had to rate and review because of the negative reviews which seemed bit stupid!,10
188,"""Titanic"" is a prescient portent of things to come, a metaphor of human conceit.We are all passengers on the Titanic, oblivious to our fate, our planet a wreck, most of us doomed to die on the iceberg of climate change. Exactly when and where disaster will strike, no one knows for sure. But somewhere an iceberg is lurking in the dark with our name on it.The most cruel part of our fate is we have a James Cameron-class writer and director running the show. The story is bogged down and going nowhere. People are losing interest fast and falling asleep as the movie rolls.The ship we call HMS Planet Earth is doomed, but no one seems to care, just like the audience in Titanic. And, like the Titanic, there are not enough lifeboats. A whole lotta people are gonna die when the clathrate gun goes off. The good news is that there won't many icebergs left, eventually.",2
189,"I am one of the few people, I think, that has not seen all of Titanic. I saw most of it, and couldn't sit through the rest.You see, I have a great interest in the *real* Titanic. And I truly believe that this three-hour 'epic' is the greatest insult to the tragedy ever to be put on film. It has nothing to do with the ship, or what really happened. The story would have been more realistic set in some city! As it is the ship is just pushed into the background of a love story that could never, and I repeat never, have happened in true life. Rose would never even have met Jack, and most likely she would not have wanted to! Steerage passengers on the Titanic, and all other ocean liners of the time, were strictly prohibited from association with the other classes, and first class held themselves so aloof that they did not even look on second class, let alone steerage, as human beings let alone material for lovers. Rose would have been raised with these attitudes; they would have been engraved in her no matter how 'free-spirited' she was! And what are the chances that a noblewoman, who has likely never done a lick of work in her life, could ever swing an axe without chopping off someone's hand? Nil.This movie is nothing but Hollywood capitalising on a tragedy that cost hundreds of lives. The only really fitting tribute to the doomed liner is Titanic the musical, which has done it's research and is a triumphant tribute to the ship and the world she sailed in, in which the characters become secondary and the doomed liner takes on a life of it's own.",1
190,"Rating: * * 1/2
James Cameron is one of the best film directors out there.  He made ""The Terminator"" in 1984, which is not only Arnold Schwarzenegger's best film, but quite simply the greatest action film ever made.  ""Aliens"" and ""The Abyss"" were excellent sci-fi films and literally invented new technology.  ""Terminator 2"" was a great sequel, and ""True Lies"" was a ton of fun.  He also made T2-3D, a cool theme park attraction.Then he made ""Titanic.""  ""T2"" was the most expensive film of its time at a hundred million dollars.  Titanic more than doubled that.  It went far over budget, in fact.  And it was well spent.  The special effects are absolutely incredible.Cameron's script, however, leaves something to be desired.  It concerns unsatisfied 1st class 16-year-old Rose (Kate Capshaw) and her romance with 3rd class con guy Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio).  His profession: wander around Paris, France drawing girls naked.  Here is problem #1.
(WARNING: minor but predictable spoiler)  In 1912, a 1st class teenaged girl sleeps with a 3rd class teen 24 hours after they meet.  Maybe, *maybe* in the  80s, but in 1912?In fact, that's the main problem.  The film revolves around a romance that is stupid and completely unbelievable.  In other words, the script stinks.The film lasts over three hours.  This is not necessarily a bad thing. All of Sergio Leone's classics last about that long.  But in Titanic, the hours are divided up in different qualities.  The first hour is fine and somewhat spectacular but not great.  The second is really stupid and ruins the film.  The last hour is superb in nearly every way.  As I have already mentioned, the special effects are awesome, and Cameron's directing abilities are at their very best.The cast is fine but not great.  I've never been much of a fan of DiCaprio, but he's okay here.  Capshaw is really good, but is outdone by Billy Zane as her slimy fiancee.This won eleven Academy Awards, which has only been done once before, for 1959's ""Ben Hur.""  Ben Hur was a true classic, and deserved it.Titanic won Best Picture, which should have gone to LA Confidential. Best Director was more or less deserved for helming something on this scale. The special effects, sets, cinematography, costumes, etc. definitely deserved it.  James Horner's score was good, but it did not deserve and Oscar as much as some of his others, like Glory and Star Trek II.  And surely this wasn't the best film song of the year.As I said in the one-line-summary, it is Cameron's worst so far... but that's not really that bad.  Steven Spielburg has made worse than this.It might not be a bad idea to see this film just for the spectacle. I just can't think of any other reason.",8
191,"I was 13 when this movie came out, remembering how impressed I was back then and still love it this day. I rewatch it every other year or so, and still get the chills, the movie stays the same but every time I watch it, I notice something different. One big thing I notice is how incredibly well it's been done (especially for back in the day) the work that went into it making it so realistic. Great chemistry between Leo & Kate, especially Kate caried this roll so well. It hits me right in my feels, and I love it when a movie does that. Now that I'm 37 and seen a lot between 1997 and now, I can definitely say Titanic is my number 1 movie of all time.",10
192,"Not many movies make me emotional, not many movies make me ponder life, and almost no movies make me cry. But I was a nervous wreck, I was shaking, I felt so many emotions. The movies that tell stories of true events are always good. But something about Titanic made it so special. I knew what was going to happen, but I still couldn't handle it. It kills me to think what everyone experienced. This movie certainly detailed what happened that day. I know I've said it before, but this is the greatest movie of all time. James Cameron is an incredible director, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were excellent, and the graphics were amazing. People who say this movie isn't good have never experienced emotion in their lives.",10
193,"Hmm, I wonder what happened at the end? I must have watched 6/8 of this film before washing the dishes seemed a more appealing chore. Many actors can perform convincingly in period films, but this cast did not convince me at all that they were anything but 1990s actors with 1990s dialog trying to look like people from the 1910s. The script was inane, leaving the viewer with only special effects for interest. In the very-near future, when high-tech special effects no longer dazzle audiences, this moneymaking venture will be re-evaluated. I'll give it a 2/10 in order to be fair to the special effects staff, who clearly labored the hardest on this film and deserve some credit.",1
194,"Checking out the other comments, one caught my eye... somebody had the gall to make a comparison between this film and Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, ""The Seven Samurai"". To compare this film with ""The Seven Samurai"" is utterly rediculous and an insult to great films. With that said, I'll continue...Let me start off with the absolute horrid screenplay that is filled with cliches. While watching this film, you can pretty much tell what is going to happen next... it's the ""Rich girl forced to marry a rich guy, but she finds a poor boy that she eventually falls in love with"" story you've seen hundereds of times before.... add a big boat, a historical disaster, and bingo, you have yourself a movie. The dialogue is almost laughably bad (""Oh Jack.... Jack!""). And the characters are almost as cliche-ridden as the story they're in. As you watch the film, you feel almost as if you're forced to like the characters.A disaster as huge as the sinking of the Titanic doesn't deserve a film like this. It is an insult to the hundreds that died in that distaster to be represented in a stereotypical film such as this. And it's winning of the best picture oscar is absolute proof that the Oscars are nothing more than a huge popularity contest anymore. To even place this in the same category with films like ""On the Waterfront"", ""Ben-Hur"", ""The African Queen"", ""Rebecca"", ""The Godfather"", etc. is such a shame, and just shows you what direction the film industry is headed.About the only good thing I could say about this film is that it is an enormous technical achievement. The recreation of the ship itself is amazing, but that alone cannot carry a film with a recycled, cliche-ridden plot such as this.",3
195,"Why did this movie made 600million dollars at the box office?it's because you people loved it.Why is this movie only rate 6.9 out of 10?It's because 10 000 people in the world didn't like it and those 10 000 votes on IMDb and the hole world would've voted on IMDb for titanic this movie would've been and 8.8 out of 10.Why is this movie not in the top 250?Well because there is not enough voters on IMDb.I don't know why people didn't like this wonderful masterpiece.Maybe because you don't like love stories and who ever doesn't shouldn't of watch this one then and go do bad comments on it.And maybe people didn't like it because it is a remake, well get over it, I like this one way more then the 1953 version and plus I like all the remakes because if Iwonna watch Walking tall well I have the choice between the good one or the bad oneI don't know why people didn't like the story.I think the story is great there could'nt of been a better one that shows the gigantic boat (titanic) sink in the middle of the Atlantic.Every thing is wonderful about this movie, the actors,the characters, the music, the visual effects, the scenery, and every thing else.Leonardo DiCaprio should've gotten en award for his great performance and Kate Winslet should've gotten one too.",10
196,"I must admit, as a movie buff, that this was the worst piece of sap-o-rama ever the ""grace"" the screen. I mean, What was the point?  It was about two little spoiled kids running around on some stupid boat saying stuff like ""I'll never let go"". Come on!!  The romantic side of it was so contrived it felt like I was being choked as I watched it.  None of the characters were even half-way decent, and all the actors were just a waste (Leo Dicaprio is a loser) the boat was the main character, and the iceberg was the supporting actor/bad guy.  Towards the end of the movie, I was hoping the boat would just sink already just to put me out of my misery.  When Kate Winslet was threatening to throw herself overboard, I was on the edge of my seat yelling ""Jump! Do it, Jump!""  James Cameron uses the death of a thousand innocent people in an attempt to illicit some emotion out of the audience, since the characters of the movie can't do it.  The only redeeming quality of the whole film was Kathy Bates, but even she couldn't save this boat from sinking.  Let's face it, the only reason there is to watch this movie is if you got a couple of hours to kill and your dentist can't give you a root canal just right now, but you want to prepare yourself for the pain.",1
197,"The tragedy here was the fact that they took what could have been a great film/story and turned it into a typical piece of Hollywood Crud!  Seriously, the acting totally sucked!  The screenplay was trite and boring.  The contrived scenes with the old Rose (not to mention with all the other characters) were so sad, this piece of garbage could only come from small minds that merely used a bunch of special effects to mask the poorly written script!  Sad, Sad, Sad.........  I know that I'm certainly not in the majority on this one, obviously by the actual take on boxoffice and video rental/sales, but I know that I can tell good acting from affected, contrived, crud - and this certainly was full of the latter!  Best Picture?!?!?!?!  Honestly, the ""Academy"" bowed to box office sales and certainly not to their consciences on rewarding quality film making or acting.... Sad, Sad, Sad!!!!!",5
198,"Titanic is the most famous ""fictional story tied into real event"" movie to date. It tells the story of a poor man who wins tickets to board the Titanic in a poker game. He and his friend board the ship in hopes of reaching New York City and starting life anew. While on board, he falls for a rich woman who is set to be married. After he saves her life, she begins to fall for him, and a passionate love story begins. However, their plans are halted abruptly when the ship hits an iceberg and begins to sink. Now it's a race against time to try and get off the ship as soon as possible.I don't care what anyone has to say about this movie. Sure, the first hour is chick flick material, and it features the clichéd rich girl/poor boy formula, but this movie is so well made, well acted, and well directed, that it deserves all the praise it gets. The movie has a 3 hour running time, but it's never really slow. Even in the sappy scenes, you're drawn in by the amazing set around the characters. James Cameron did a great job directing this movie. The recreation of the interior of the Titanic is amazing. It's like they're filming inside the real ship. Though the first hour is mainly a love story, it still can keep the guys entertained because it's not a long drawn out drama. Cameron keeps amazing balance between continuing the love story and telling the story of the disaster in the second half of the film. The sinking scenes are fantastic. Finally, the most accurate portrayal of the Titanic's demise on film. This movie has drama, action, and some comedy. It manages to tell a great story and be a highly entertaining action film at the same time.The performances are very good. Not one performance in this movie is flawed. Everybody involved is extremely talented and they all do very well in their parts.Overall, despite what anyone says about this movie, it doesn't change the fact that it's an epic film with a great story and amazing visuals.9/10",9
199,"Went to watch this on a date because, my then GF wanted to see it like most of the female population. It rumbles along at a steady pace with not much happening apart from some good effects and a boring love story. The story between the two lead actors feels awkward and false.

With dialouge so frickin' corny that just made me want to throw a brick through my TV screen. Even at the end, that rotten, stupid cow could have let Leo share the plank she was on, but no, she decides to let him die! What the hell is up with that! When are people going to realize that all the special effects in the world aren't going to compensate for jejune scripts such as this one. It too bad that Cameron didn't line a few bird cages with his script to this manipulative, sugar coated bore-feast, if he would have, it would have put to good use.",1
201,"An excellent version of the 1953 original as well as the 1956 ""A Night to Remember.""We really have character development in this fine picture. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet shine as our doomed hero and heroine. In a comeback performance, Gloria Stuart does very well in the part of Winslet as an old woman.What is so enjoyable about this film is the sociological depiction of the upper and lower classes. We can see from almost the beginning of the disaster, the lower class will be doomed to tragedy.Frances Fisher gives excellent support as Kate's upper class mean mother. This is a mother so mean that Kate went through life never revealing to her that she had survived.Di Caprio, it has been argued, looked too young for the part. He really seemed to mature as the film went on. His scene before his demise was well done and memorable.",10
202,"TITANIC (1997) **** Leonardo Di Caprio, Kate Winslet, Bill Paxton, Gloria Stuart, Kathy Bates, Billy Zane, Suzi Amis, Frances Fisher, Victor Garber, David Warner. The most expensive film ever made and worth every penny (some $200 million!) that now ranks the international blockbuster box office champ in cinema history ($600 million plus!!) : filmmaker James Cameron's labor of love and exquisite depiction and detail obsession pays off in a monumental way in his fictional account of the infamous/tragic maiden (and doomed, final) voyage of the S.S. Titanic focusing on star-crossed lovers (Di Caprio in his star-confirming turn as a steerage passenger and Winslet as a very proper young lady engaged to wealthy cad Zane, all by the way perfect) facing the ultimate tale of survival as the vast ship of luxury and riches slowly begins to sink thanks to its fated collision with an iceberg in The North Sea.Seamlessly edited footage of actual size set of the vessel, digital computer generated effects and visuals of the remains of the real Titanic at the bottom of the ocean eerily woven into a tapestry of visceral impact and execution. The last third of the film of the sinking, mostly in real time, is unforgettable. Cameron pulls off the impossible with perfection despite the odds of being lambasted for the largesse of the film's budget (ironically like the Titanic's own criticism for size over substance). An instant classic that won Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Editing, Sound, Sound Effects Editing, Art Direction, Cinematography, Dramatic Score, Visual Effects, Costume Design and for the ubiquitous yet stirring Best Song 'My Heart Will Go On' sung by Celine Dion. A near sweep (it lost screenplay, actress and supporting actress but not bad: 11 out of 14!)",
203,"When it comes to pure visual spectacle, Titanic is one of the best movies ever made. But the love story is great as well. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have such wonderful chemistry that it makes the occasionally poor dialogue tolerable. Their scenes together are some of the most memorable moments in romantic movie history.However, the visuals steal the show. The scenes of the Titanic sinking are some of the most beautiful yet terrible scenes ever filmed. Beautiful because it looks so real, and terrible because we know this actually happened. But that's not to say the love story is shoved into the background. The romance takes up most of the film, and their tragic ending is one that is sure to draw tears from the sensitive ones.Overall, the film is well-acted, visually masterful, and unforgettably romantic. By now, it is an absolute classic and, in my opinion, it certainly deserved it's Best Picture win at the Oscars.",2
204,IMO this movie is 2nd only to Forrest Gump.. Epic love-story with amazing action scenes.,10
205,Great emotional impact held by a sweep-you-off-your-feet epic romance and disaster movie. You can not get any better than this. What really made this movie matter was one thing: it launched the A-list acting careers of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. DiCaprio saw the role's potential when offered it and has had an impressive career since due to his stellar performance here. Winslet campaigned heavily for the role she got it and the same thing happened to her where her stellar performance brought about an impressive career. Give this one a try and see if you like it. I hope you do. Also I hope you can get past the displays of artistic license taken with some of the historical facts. Hope you have fun watching any movie you choose to watch because that's what movies are for. It's the art of entertainment.,10

207,"""Titanic"",like ""Gone with the wind"" is one of the great unrateable movies. Just as GWTW caught the imagination of the public in its time so ""Titanic"" repeated the feat sixty years later.Neither one of them is a ""great"" movie in the artistic or intellectual sense,but both of them are great movies in terms of sheer populist entertainment and their grasp of the mood of the moment.Possibly even ""opportunist"" might be the right word. Both of them had huge lead roles and nothing much else for their actors,both featured highly unlikely romances between people from different social stratas.GWTW had the burning of Atlanta,brilliant state - of - the - art filming,and ""Titanic"" has the sinking of the ship which is hugely impressive by any standards. Ten years down the line it looks better to me than it did on it's release. Mr L. diCaprio,a little like a mixture of James Cagney and Mickey Rooney, is feisty and funny as Jack,Kate Winslet full of vitality and a slightly knowing innocence,hold the film together during its occasional longeurs,and their coupling is sweet and funny if highly unlikely. Forget all the ""buts"" and allow yourself to be swept along,lingering in the chandeliered dining rooms, strolling the endless decks and watch the stokers toil in the massive engine rooms like Dore's vision of Hell. The whole thing is a brilliantly assembled mish - mash of movie clichés one following the other seamlessly so that you don't care that you're watching sheer corn because it's so well done. The opening sequence with the 102 year - old Rose on the Diving ship is patiently built up with gradually lengthening flashbacks to 1912. The ending, where Rose,after telling her story goes out on the deck in the middle of the night and lets the priceless diamond she has had all along slip into the ocean then........no,on the remote chance that you haven't seen the movie I won't go any further.But I will pay the ultimate tribute to Mr Cameron and confess that I have watched ""Titanic"" six times and every damn time,no matter how much I tell myself I am being manipulated by a succession of still photographs being projected at just the right speed to cause persistence of vision..........I cry. Furthermore I would say that anybody not similarly affected would not feature highly on my Christmas Card list. This is film - making of the highest order and I take my hat off to everybody involved.",9
208,"I saw this movie when it first came out in theater and the whole theater was packed and for good reason. This has many elements to make a good romance movie, yeah it gets a bit sappy and corny but that is passable. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie when it first came out but acted like I hated it for the sake of hating it. Because it came out sometime when I was in elementary school and all the kids back then was making fun of this movie. Although some of them probably enjoyed watching this movie as well. This is the movie that made Leonardo DiCaprio and made him a teenage heartthrob. So the plot is basically this to put it simply, it's about a romance that blossoms on a ship called Titanic between a poor guy named name Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCario) and Rose(Kate Winslet). But Rose is engaged to a douche but the romance between Jack and Rose increases even during the sinking of the ship. I am not giving anything away since anyone that knows a bit of history knows that the Titanic sank. And when the human nature when it comes to survival kicks in, that is done in a pretty realistic manner. Even if the romance aspect of this movie is pretty straightforward but at least it's engaging and that is what matters. Everything from the cinematography to special effects were phenomenal for a movie from the late 90's and it's still spot on today. I finally got the chance to see this movie in 3D again and it was still good. And the conversion to 3D is done well.7.9/10",7
209,"When James Cameron staple, Bill Paxton, uttered the words: ""Are you ready to go back to Titanic?"" I hadn't actually been sure as of late. For, I've seen it three times in the theatres back in 97/98 and maybe once more on VHS a year or two later. I've had the score and ""song"" memorized since and, of course, I knew the outcome.Well, when the movie opened, I felt more than ready. Gone were the thoughts: ""Be prepared, this is three plus hours"" and I was once again mesmerized from minute one all the way until minute 194. This near-masterpiece made me miss how movies are supposed to made: with heart and talent. And that year, plenty were: some of other best picture nominations, L.A. Confidential, Good Will Hunting, and As Good as it Gets, were also utterly fantastic. Sadly, since 1997, we're lucky to have ONE made with such heart and incredible talent per year.By now, everyone knows the story and has since copied it multiple times. Let me make this clear: VERY few have made one with such a great script with believable dialogue, excellent actors and above all-else, chemistry. Kate and Leo had it in spades. From the second Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) looked up when new-friend, Tommy (Jason Barry) was talking to him, and saw Rose (Kate Winslet,) I KNEW they captured true love.Since this movie arrived 15 years ago, I've been a pretty good fan of Kate, but not so much Leo. He suffers from Denzelitis whereas almost every role he performs, he's not trying to act; he's JUST trying to win an Oscar. This annoying habit leads to way too much over-acting and an abundance of screaming. (SEE: practically any Leo or Denzel Washington role since 1997.)But...Leo pulled it off here. Truly, he showed such a deep affection, love and purity towards his costar that I believed every word, every action and that Rose's heart will go on. He did it so well, with each viewing, I always envisioned her life, the rest of it from the Titanic sinking until her death with him in her heart.These two, Rose and Jack amongst a few other decent characters, namely the fantastic Kathy Bates as The Unsinkable Molly Brown, were so good and deep that I never mind that it's about an hour and a half or more before the ""special effects"" kick in. I.E. The ship sinks. (Oops, sorry, spoiler.)That's the genius of James Cameron. His heart and soul was in this project. He nearly bankrupted the studio and himself and practically gave himself a bad name prior to opening – which was rescheduled more than once. He didn't just make an hour and half retelling of a sinking ship, even though he had the technology. And he didn't just put two romantic leads together; he made sure that the fictional love backdrop was as real as the amazing sinkage.To give an example of an ""epic"" retelling following Titanic that did not have the qualities needed to further an ""opening buildup"" of a romance is Peter Jackson's King Kong. It was flat, boring and unconvincing. He sure had the talent – Kong looked real, but sadly that CGI character held the most depth in the movie.Beyond the romance – that, yes, made me tear again after all these years/viewings and only because I believed the true love before me, was the ultimate score, one of the best songs, movie hit or not, excellent dialogue spoken – mostly by Leo and Molly Brown, great special effects and breathtaking cinematography. I had to see this on the big screen again, although I would've MOST preferred to have the option of 2-D.I would love to see a new movie of such deep quality and soul like this spend a deserved 15-weeks at number one at the box office that I would strongly stand behind. Recently, The Hunger Games did a decent four weeks at number one, and the highly inferior to both movies, Avatar, did seven. But both were just simple blockbusters. Not heart-felt movies. Not movies I would rate 5/5 stars – my highest honor of reviews.Sadly, James Cameron's follow-up, the Space Gully with Wolves film, Avatar, brought down Titanic's mind-blowing record box-office receipts. Oh, how I wished with the 2012 re-release with the ""ho-hum"" 3-D format would've have reclaimed the top spot. But it isn't to happen. And that's okay. It's still a great movie, still holds up today, still makes me laugh and cry and still makes me feel love all over again for movie making. If you are one of the six people in the world that hasn't seen it, SEE TITANIC.Side Note: Way back in the day, when internet was really just kick starting and we had things like ""I.M.'ing"" each other, I was involved in a long-distance relationship and I actually typed out Céline Dion's song, My Heart Will Go On to my partner that thoroughly made him blush.Side Note II: As stated, I watched this three times in the theatre following its initial release. On the last turn, I was on a first date with a guy – against all warnings from my friends to make Titanic a ""first date"" movie. Well, it did turn out to be the first and last date. This was his first viewing of Titanic and still, he fell asleep around hour one and awoke right before (spoiler!) Jack dies. I know my date was awoken because his snores stopped and he instantly began weeping. Frustrated, I said in a normal voice, despite being in the theatre, ""What do you have to be crying about? You don't even know these characters!"" Yep, that was the last I saw of him.",10
210,"There has been nothing similar before and it's hard to imagine something like titanic will ever be created that masterfully & epic again.
I will not respond to any low ratings and leave these viewers alone with their well, opinion. To me TITANIC is the definition of perfection. It came to the absolutely right time. Maybe a few years earlier or later the impact to society would have been less big or even bigger? anyway it influenced a whole generation and even a decade later it has not lost a single spark. It's still the one and only benchmark for any movie. Titanic inspires young and old, brings everyone with a heart to tears and impresses with the highest level of detail in movie making. I'm so thankful I was part of the premiere and the re-screening.
Titanic delivers the perfect 10 on all levels. The attention to detail, eg the dishes and furniture have been all recreated 1:1 to the original. The cast, Katy Bates & esp Kate Winslet (who, in my opinion was shockingly robbed to win her 1st academy award. Alone for heart breaking deleted scene where she had a mental breakdown was one of the best performances by any actress !) and then of course the score: haunting & epic. Recognizable under millions of other melodies including the modern classic my heart will go on.
And when this beautiful ship hits the iceberg and the desaster evolves into the inevitable I know I will weep at exactly the same scenes ... and I'll never let go.",10
211,I saw this movie in the theatre's back in 1997 and remembered it as a brilliant movie. The cinematic experience was one of the best of my life even though the story is tragic and very sad. I recently watched this film with my 13 year old daughter. The magic is still there. This is still one of the best movies of all time and perhaps the greatest love story of all time. The new blue ray release is fantastic and James Horner's score is still timeless. Great job James Cameron...for producing a once in a lifetime film. Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet were fantastic in this film and both deserved best actor/actress awards.Don't be afraid to bring this one back out people... its still a beautiful epic that will stand the test of time.,10
212,"OK, i don't know what everyone else was thinking while voting, but i'd sure like to voice my opinion...loudly.1. i'm very disappointed with the limited recognition this beautiful movie has on IMDb. i would expect more from movie lovers.2. it's very hard to find a movie that all ages can enjoy with comedy, tragedy, truth and love. which Titanic clearly delivers.3. acting was outstanding, not to mention the unforgettable music and effects.Titanic, in my opinion, is a milestone in leo's and kate's careers. Many of the scenes in the movie stay with you after you've watched it. Not just the tragedy or romance, but the vast gap presented amongst the 'rich' and 'poor', who are treated in proportion with their money. I absolutely love this movie.",9
213,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I went into the theater thinking ""this is going to be just another disaster movie"", but was totally bowled over by what I witnessed. As the huge liner was breaking apart, it was as though I were sitting in a smaller vessel nearby observing the entire ordeal. The camera work was as realistic as could be expected, the acting was very good, the script completely believable. It was the epitome of savage action, wondrous romance, and heartbreaking loss. This film will remain one of my all time favorites from now on.",
214,"At the first time I watched 'Titanic'I didn't like it very much, because I was 11 years old and I was not a big fan of Romance. The only thing I remember that I payed attention and really liked at that time was the Titanic sinking!*laugh* Well, 8 years have been passed, and now, more mature and having read about the real accident I can say that I enjoyed this movie very much. The romance between Jack(DiCaprio) and Rose(Winslet) is fictional, but make the movie be even more dramatic,since we have a chance of be closer of some people in the story. The way the movie begins, showing some people making the search of Titanic and even some shots of the ship forgot in the sea is very interesting and in the last scene, when the old Rose dies, it's a beautiful and symbolic scene to see her meeting again Jack and all the people that were killed in Titanic's disaster again.Ps:This is one of the movies that I saw Kate Winslet, and I found her astonishing!",9
215,"Titanic is my all-time favorite film. This film breathed life back into the Hollywood epic. Sadly, many people don't see it as an epic. They see it as a romantic chick flick that only focuses on the love story. But contrary to popular belief, the film focuses just as much on the ship as it does on the love story. It blends fact and fiction so well in a way that you rarely ever see on film. Movies like this are very easy to make, but there's very hard to make well and almost impossible to make great. It is also probably the most emotional moving film I've ever seen. It's the only movie that made me genuinely cry. It also has one of the important life morals: only life is priceless and making each day count. Although, I do have to admit that the dialogue is predictable and at times stilted. But that doesn't stop it from being a masterpiece. Because there is nothing in the film that I would improve, I'm giving it a 10/10 RATING.",10
216,"I think what I most admire about this film is how it is accessible to everyone. If you are interested in romance it has an earnest love triangle that is structured like a classic melodrama, i.e. Woman caught between the poor guy who represents liberation and the rich guy who represents safety. If you are interested in history it handles the Titanic story in a straight forward way and all the well known aspects are covered, i.e. The band playing during the sinking. If you are an action fan the actual sinking is quite impressive and engaging. If you are interested in cinematic techniques the film is a showcase of then cutting edge effects. And if you are so inclined to be snarky about any of that the film let's you be with relative ease. None of these threads really dominate the film and Cameron does a great job balancing all of them. I don't think everyone will like this film but I can't imagine how somehow would utterly hate it; it is harmless and there are so many worse films to slag on..For my money I rather enjoy the old fashioned spirit and how earnest the film is. Both because it is fun to be snarky about Jack and Rose. (JACK! ROSE!). But more often than not I rather get swept up in the melodrama. I utter aware of the writing issues and yet I still feel melancholy at the end of the film.On my last re-watch I was struck by how well the special effects have stood up over time. There are shots/effects here and there that no longer work fully but on the whole the film presents the sinking and the like in a very believable way. Cameron does a great job of mixing up the illusions to make it all work.Yes this is a middle brow film; but films that capture the industry's attention and the public's awe tend to be middlebrow.",10
217,"Titanic is a staggeringly expensive and elegant love story, set against one of the most shocking maritime tragedies in history. Prior to its release, the media had their knives out for director James Cameron and were poised like vultures to cut him down to size. The budget had spiralled out-of-control, the film was scheduled with a running time of 3 hours, and everyone predicted a critical and financial disaster of unprecedented magnitude. As it turns out, Titanic is actually a good film. Not an excellent film, which many people seem to suggest, but definitely a good film. The second half in particular, which deals with the sinking of the ship and the chaos and panic that sweeps through the passengers, is very well made cinema.In the present, treasure hunters discover aboard the wreckage of the Titanic a drawing of a naked woman wearing a priceless diamond necklace. An old lady named Rose (Gloria Grahame) sees the drawing on the TV news. She calls in immediately, claiming that she is the woman in the picture. Rose is flown out to the dive centre in the Atlantic, where she narrates the story of how she came to be the subject of the drawing. She tells how a penniless American youth, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), won a ticket onto the Titanic during a card game in Southampton. She tells how she as a young woman (Kate Winslet) was travelling in first-class with her fiancée, banker Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), and how the two of them were unhappy in their relationship. Gradually, Jack - an aspiring artist - and Rose came together and began to fall in love. Then, the unthinkable happened and the Titanic hit an iceberg....For 90 minutes or so, Titanic almost lives down to the disastrous reputation that had been predicted of it before its release. It is a naive, slushy romantic story in which the love affair that develops is unconvincing and unbelievable. The characters of Rose, Jack and Cal are lifted straight from the pages of a Barbara Cartland-style, clichéd love-and-passion romance. But the film dramatically improves once the iceberg strikes. Cameron is into more comfortable territory at this point, showing his dazzling technical talents and his mastery of spectacle and excitement in a prolonged sinking sequence of true quality. The film suddenly becomes more purposeful and urgent, more exciting and moving. For upwards of an hour, we witness an authentic and harrowing event from a perspective of remarkable realism.Titanic eventually emerged as a phenomenally successful film, and recouped all its budgetary outlay plus a whole lot more. It also made the critics eat the words of their negative predictions. Yes, the opening stretch isn't up to much..... but the ship-sinking sequence more than compensates, and transforms this into a very commendable film.",7
218,"Such a beautiful love story. one of the most legendary movies ever made, and i love it so much! acting is really amazing, leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are both so talented and they nailed their parts! the plot is super good, and i don't think this classic contains any negative things, except jack's death and the fact that this movie is very sad.. but i'm still giving it a 10 because let's face it, it's a classic. duh",10
219,"There are a ton of problems in ""Titanic"" – the cartoon villains, the stilted dialog, much of it obviously re-recorded in post production. Some weak supporting performances, the betrayal of a number of historical facts, and taking what was already one of the most dramatic nights of the 20th century and needlessly pumping it up with chases, gunfire, theft, scheming, etc. Yet a lot works. As much as I didn't want to give in, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio make a great, old fashioned, star crossed romantic couple. Many of the effects and stunts are amazing (although at other times you realize some wide shots are basically giant video-game like cartoons). And it made me cry -- while I felt like a fool for being swept up in it's shameless melodrama. I can't argue that ""Titanic"" is art, or deep, or a great film, but I can say it's a terrifically effective entertainment that everyone should see at least once.",7
220,"How could I not give this film a 10/10. Sure, there is some corny dialogue and some romance that gets a bit too sentimental for my taste, but that doesn't hold this film back from greatness. It's the best romance film ever made and will have you tearing up no doubt. Once the iceberg is hit, the film goes to another level. The already well established characters are thrown into this tragedy that had me glued to the screen. Cameron's production is far ahead of it's time and deserves all the praise that it gets. The ending is also something that really makes me think about life and death, as a philosophical thinker. Having a dreamlike state after death and seeing what you truly care about...meeting up with the ones you love...is heaven. It's such a beautiful ending and gives me chills everytime.",10
221,"Tatanic was as good as its name sounds strong, epic, and adventurous.
I know this movie word for word from start to finish!",10
222,"We start off this epic classic with Mr. Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) in search of the Heart Of the Ocean necklace that would be found in the Titanic wreckage. After failing to find it and revealing so on television, Rose (Gloria Stuart), a survivor calls up Brock to go for visit.Rose quickly gets into the story of her experience on Titanic. We travel back in time to when Rose was young (Kate Winslet). Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an aspiring artist who wins himself and his friend, Fabrizio (Danny Nucci), tickets on Titanic. Almost instantly, Jack falls for Rose - regardless of her being with Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).One night, Rose runs to the back of the boat. She leans off the rail ready to jump into the waters below - hopefully to her death. Jack sees her doing this and talks her out of it. Just as he is about to pull her in, she slips. He does bring her back over, but not before Cal has come to the rescue. Jack is seen as a hero and is invited to dinner the following night.Rose begins to have feelings for Jack and they also begin to see each other frequently. Rose poses nude for Jack, wearing only the Heart Of the Ocean. They are chased by Lovejoy (David Warner) but eventually get away and make love in a storage room, inside a vehicle.I am not one for movies that go over 180 minutes, but this one has always been an exception for the reasons of it not feeling like three hours and for it being a romance. Leonardo DiCaprio is not a favourite of mine. I hated him in almost anything else, so it's safe to say that I think this is his best performance.Kate Winslet was a no-name at this point and that was on purpose, but she was quickly noticed after this for such an amazing performance. It's no wonder why she was nominated for an Oscar. She is just so easy to fall in love with.James Cameron wrote and directed this masterpiece and does anyone wonder why it won 11 Oscars, and made $1.8 billion? It deserves all the praise it gets simply because it is an epic romance movie. The only epic romance I know. The score is just magnificent and it easily put James Horner on the map.It had a great supporting cast: Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill, Victor Garber, and Jonathan Hyde. The dialogue between Rose and Jack is sweet and warm-hearted. The action during the last hour is what really makes this so epic. The romance itself is fairy tale.The special effects are also stunning. I can't think of any flaws in this movie which is why I obviously give it a perfect score. Any romantic person will love this. Any couple should watch this together because it certainly speaks to you in that sense.I don't know if there is another movie out there in this genre that compares to Titanic. Which is why I recommend everyone to watch this.",10
223,"Actually reading a lot of the previous reviews (lots of them) has restored my faith in humanity.I half expected to read 'best film ever' which pops up far too often for average films that hollywood rams down people's throats.This film was so poor.  I'm generally a fan of Cameron and normally his writing is very good, but the sub plot to this film was appalling.  Why did Rose, who was meant to be English played by an English actress have a bad American accent.  Why did every Englishman/woman on the boat (which incredibly was an English ship you know, not American as the film tries to push) an evil nasty character.The acting was probably the worst in film history and the love story was so silly and badly done.  All the scenes on the boat looked like Hollywood stage sets.It's very disturbing that a film like this can win Oscar recognition.  It was bad enough that Braveheart won an Oscar, but that was much better than this.Film making and hype at its worst from a normally reliable director.",1
224,"Are there lesser films in execution and entertainment? Of course. But I felt a ""One"" vote was deserved here for the overratedness of this movie by box-office and awards. I think the Oscars should be embarrassed this won all those Oscars, including Best Picture. As another commenter pointed out, it is funny that such a bloated film won ""Best Editing"". Honestly, this winning Best Picture would be like ""Ghost"" winning that award: a popular, sappy movie with pretty leads.. Only this lacks the actually humorous Whoopi...The ""romance"" is laughable. I like Winslet. She has at least tried to steer clear of this type of stuff since. Actually, mostly, so has DeCrapio...Malcolm X and Gandhi's lives: those are worthy of three hours(plus) of film..NOT this ""eternal romance""..Some people are simply impressed by the sinking. I'm sorry, but if there isn't one person on the ship I care about, the sinking does not mean much to me. Spectacle? Try nature. Go watch a volcano...BTW, I will say I think it is hilarious that people refer to Winslet as a ""cow"" in this because she isn't an anorexic actress. I honestly initially was perplexed whom they were even referring to, because Bates isn't even all that fat. Like they wouldn't want Kate as their girlfriend? Come on...I would certainly never want to see this one again...The script fails to portray an ""eternal love"". Rather it gives us a bit of lust. While it is believable Winslet doesn't want to be permanently with Zane, why she has to be with Leo is not shown...I t is encouraging that this is not in the IMDb Top 250...Perhaps the worst film to ever win Best Picture.",1
225,"Titanic, the largest moving object of her time hit an iceberg and sank on her maiden voyage leaving untold stories behind. When she was found on the ocean floor she was still facing west. The china have never been used, the sheets have never been slept in. Titanic was called the ship of dreams. It set sail on 10 April 1912 from Southampton and sank on 14 April 1912 hitting an iceberg. James Cameron took an interest in this story because of his passion for shipwrecks. He calls Titanic as ""Mount Everest of shipwrecks."" In the film, treasure hunter Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) shares the very same passion for a different reason. He is searching for a priceless diamond called ""Heart of the Ocean"" in the wreck of Titanic. During this search he discovers a drawing of a young woman wearing nothing but that diamond. This woman turns out to be still alive at the age of 101 and has a different story to tell about the ill-fated ship.Back in its time Titanic was the most expensive film that has ever been made. Its budget was estimated $200 million. It grossed worldwide $1.84 billion which made Titanic the first film to hit billion-dollar mark. We all know how the film is going to end and yet again we watch. Even more important, James Cameron convinces the production company to invest $200 Million in a film which is about a ship that is going to sink and a sequel is not even possible. One logical explanation to all this madness is, he really believed in Titanic and his own talents as a director, writer and producer. Of course, I haven't forgotten his high-rated films like The Terminator, The Terminator II, Aliens and The Abyss. All those films were a great reference for Titanic, but I believe with a possible failure, his career would have ended forever. He took the risk and it worked. Faith in Titanic made him the king of the world. He is still one of the most successful directors of all time. Titanic won 11 Oscars out of 14 nominations making it the film with the most Oscars won by a single film.James Cameron used latest cinema technology to make Titanic. He even waited for years for this film to be possible. But the story he is telling is a simple one. It is a love story between two people from different social classes. What makes this classic drama a special one is that it is happening in a ship which is going to sink and a lot of people will die including the boy. He wanted his audience to really feel what it was really like to be on Titanic. He took a turn from the story and showed us some powerful scenes to reflect that tragedy to its limits. This is one of the strongest points of Titanic. In 195 minutes, audience feels every human emotion possible. In the film, James Cameron uses the power of soundtracks, intelligent conversations and non-verbal scenes to bring us where he wants us to be.The love between Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) happens within four days but echoes to the eternity. This is why one of the taglines of the film is ""Nothing on Earth Could Come Between Them."" You can still see the love and passion in the eyes of old Rose while telling her story after 84 years like it happened yesterday. In this point of view the transmission of all the emotions through Rose to the audience is another strong point of the film. It makes people believe and show sympathy in her story. This makes sinking the ship even harder but it must happen. Drama is the main genre of Titanic. After drama it comes romance because there is a great love, acting and chemistry between Rose and Jack. These extraordinary performances helped Titanic become one of the greatest films of cinema history. The success of the film opened the way to stardom both for Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio.While knitting his story inch by inch, James Cameron takes a moment to point out how rotten our society is with its gaps between social classes. In the night of the accident 1503 recorded passengers lost their lives. This number could have been much less if the lifeboats would have been filled up to its limits. It is shown that some of the lifeboats sailed with little people because the comfort of first-class people was still a priority.Showing real scenes from the Titanic and combining them with the film was brilliant. I have also enjoyed the shooting of the iconic scene where Jack holds Rose from behind at the edge of the ship opening their hands. We see them from different camera angles. If you pay attention there are quite a few scenes that gave the audience goosebumps and this is only possible with a good cinematography. So here is a special thanks to Russell Carpenter.Casting to the soundtracks, Titanic is a work of passion. It is one of the few films that combines a real story with a work of fiction in an artistic way. Films like this can be made but they can't be made perfect. James Cameron managed to make it perfect.",9
226,"I know this is the best (overrated) movie of all, so I watched this film...it earn its place as the best movie of all time. The visual surprising still holds up for a movie that came out 2 decades ago, the music score is the best thing I ever heard, the cinematography is beautifully shot, and the tone of the movie is very lovable and emotional. Watching this for first time is such a blast, but sadly, I won't have that same feeling again if I go watch it again. This movie is very memorable for generations to come.",10
227,"Now, this movie made over 1 Billion dollars, and I'm happy to say that not a single one of those dollars were mine. I have seen it, but I saw it at a company preview, and I work at a video store, so free videos. Now, don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie, but the hype that went on over it and the out pour of praise for Leonardo DiCaprio, from fans that came out of the wood work, who really didn't appreciate Leo's previous and better work, such as This Boy's Life and The Basketball Diaries, now they were good movies.Everyone was urged to see this movie, it was almost uncool not to have seen. If someone had asked you if you had seen it and you answered no, they thought you were crazy. Well I decided to make a stand against it. This movie was pure Hollywood, no real story, it was pretty obvious what was going to happen with the love story, and I can't believe it made so much money, I mean everyone knew the ending............It sank.If you are to watch it, make sure you watch an original copy with surround sound, or better yet see it on DVD. Now I don't mean to sound harsh, but come on, it wasn't that good to warrant a billion dollars.",6
228,"This movie is absolutely amazing and deserves a higher score. i can understand why someone would give it a low rating, because of all the romance, but i personally love the romance. it makes me feel closer to the characters. also, leo and kate have great chemistry. this movie will make you smile and cry, the first half is cute and fun and the second half is so heartbreaking. love love love it.",10
229,"I will not accuse this of being the most over-rated film I've yet seen, because, first, it has its share of redeeming qualities, and second, that honor has to go to The Illusionist (which in many ways was actually a lame attempt to ape the Titanic formula, but I've already blasted that one into the ground). Neither can I fault it for grossing so much: a film that shamelessly panders to over-emoted teenage girls is bound to produce a good showing at the box-office. But the fact that a sloppy period piece that insults the period it pays tribute to could earn such lavish sycophantic adulation from nearly all reviewers (especially celebrity film writers) is just more evidence that America's thought-élitejournalists, politicians, and academics alikehave got to be the most degenerate, gullible, and monolithic in the Western world.There are two intertwined reasons why Titanic is on balance worth seeing: the historical setting and the special effects. Enough has been written on the latter, and on the former, as well, but as an Atlantic historian I cannot express enough love for anything so exquisitely and meticulously designed floating on the ocean of my heritage, just around the time my family was making its way over from Europe. Older Rose's remark that, ""It was the ship of dreams. And it was. It really was,"" ring so true. I beseech my readers: regard the volume of immigrant ship traffic in the era, admire the interior of the ship and the costumes of the passengers and contrast them to the most luxurious modern cruise liners, in an era where ships are often not a necessity, and consider how much the Western world lost in less than a century. (This sort of aesthetic history lesson is the same reason I love Chariots of Fire.)Regard, admire, compare and consider... if, that is, you can get past a script that hangs together like a soggy potato chip and pays not the least attention to real historical personages.Our two protagonists are at best naïvely laughable and at worst totally unsympathetic, their antagonists little more than cartoon characters. That the former speak like modern teenagers is quite appropriate, because they clearly ARE modern teenagers pitted against the backward old fogies of the era. Jack is a romanticized Bohemian bum with little that could possibly seduce a beautiful young Anglo-American socialite away from her privileged life. Rose wants us to believeand she convinces Jack, somehowthat deep down she's some sort of fiery rebel, yet what I saw was a girl alternating between doing the bidding of her wealthy, domineering cardboard-cutout fiancé Cal and the bidding of her impoverished, sappy, cardboard-looking loverboy Jack. There's so much ham and cheese at work you'll want to take a fork and start eating.And there is something utterly vile about their story, which, again, is clearly aimed at adolescent females, and that fact makes Titanic's moral tone all the more disturbing. This is a film with an agenda: all the authority figures are stupid murderous bigots, the 17-year-old heroine is glorified for rebelling against her mother and fornicating with a wild rover, and don't forget that wicked cabin church excluding third-class passengers from attending the Sunday service on that fateful last day of Titanic's voyage.In reality, the whole ship was completely segregated. I am told church services were excepted, though I have my doubts, but not because of snobbery on anyone's part. Third-class passengers were largely immigrants without medical certificates and in that era of the great migrations, were required to register at Ellis Island; hence U.S. law required complete segregation on all inbound European ships. And, on these grounds, it scarcely needs saying, such a liaison between Jack and Rose, far from stupid and implausible, was quite impossible.Finally, despite the segregation, Doug Phillips has pointed out, ""there is no credible evidence that first-class passengers were given priority seating rights. To the contrary, there are numerous accounts of first-class passengers giving up their seats and assisting third-class passengers into lifeboats.""There are plenty of other factual gaffes, many of them less severe (such as the bad British accents), but by far the most appalling is the libelous depiction of the ship's crew. There is no evidence that William Murdoch accepted bribes from a cowardly aristocrat, nor that he shot two men, nor that he subsequently committed suicide, and so far as I know, such a portrayal was a completely ad hoc invention on the writers' part. (James Cameron's apology to the Murdoch family was too little, too late.) The surviving passengers testified that the crew performed their duties sacrificially and heroically that evening. That is the biggest sin of this film: the real heroes of the Titanic tragedy (with the exception of Thomas Andrews) are washed over or even villanized in favor of capricious brats, only one of whom gets his comeuppance.Even so, towards the ship's final gasp of life, we do get a good sense of the imminent terror not only in Jack and Rose, but in all 1,500 souls who perished that evening. The worst moment had to be the power outage: it's those last, frightening milestones on the road to destruction that remind you where you are headed irreversibly, and the scene of the actual sinking captures this perfectly. The true story of the RMS Titanic, from its building to its sinking, and even its aftermath as grown Belfast men whose labor on that ship had been the pride and joy of their city wept in the streets at the news of her demise, is beautifully tragic and inspirational. Would that this film had captured more than a few minutes of that.",3
230,"I hear a lot about this movie,the movie was good not so great or masterpiece it was between okay and a good movie,the best thing about the movie was the background score,i think bgm was really good,it is almost like a trance",7
231,"This film is about Rose DeWitt Bukater, a rich girl, and Jack Dawson, a poor boy who both fall in love on the ship, Titanic, in which it sank in 1912.This is a very wonderful film with great romance and peril. The special effects are terrific in the film. It's top notch with the action scenes and keeps the suspense going on the film. Well, that's the second half of the film.The first half is a great romance. We see Rose when she old (obviously, she survived) and she's telling the tale to ones who want to seek treasure in the ship. They don't believe her but as she tells the story, they do.I wasn't some of the millions who have seen this movie in the theater because I was practically five and there was no way that I would recognize this film. Now that I've finally seen the whole film, I've always seen the ending but never the whole movie, I loved it. I thought the first hour was going to be a waste because I don't imagine a film going 3 hours long unless the sinking occurs in the end but it occurred in the second half of the film.The acting by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are great. they have great chemistry in the film and others like Billy Zane and Kathy Bates are good too.This is one of the best films ever. It has great action scenes and is a great tale of romance and should be seen by people who likes watching movies.",10
232,"I find it hard to believe people are still spending money to see this. The clichés, the glitz, the kitsch are enough to make one choke - like some plastic Madonna designed as a back-drop to a Wagnerian opera by Walt Disney on a Sterno binge. But the real flaw is that it just goes on and on, milking every possible tear from the eyes of deluded teenagers who read one historical 'romance' novel too many.I don't even know why I watched it through the end - except it was on cable, and a documentary on the real Titanic tragedy was immediately scheduled after. (Watching it free is the only way to see this wretched excess without giving the studio hacks behind it the wrong idea, that it might have been worth making - it wasn't.) Anyway, I thought the people freezing took an awful long time going to meet their maker. But perhaps they were waiting to meet the maker of this movie, who obviously took a vacation during the corporate filming of it. Needed extra time to count the money from the suckers, doncha know....A complete travesty of anything like real historical drama.",1
233,"All these years I've never wanted to sit down and watch this movie for various reasons. Yesterday, I just decided to randomly sit down and watch this movie, expecting nothing but a cheesy over the top romance movie. I was pleasantly surprised and blown away.As a person whose only ever seen Cameron's big three: T2, Aliens and Terminator, I never thought that any movie could ever near those three films. I have yet to see 'Avatar' which I will sometime but back to topic- Titanic blew me away as I had such low expectations.Everyone knows the story of 'Titanic', where a young boy and girl meet and fall in love. As time goes by, Titanic crashes into an iceberg causing the ship to slowly start to sink as the romance between the two gets stronger. Everyone also knows that this movie is somewhat considered one of the best and has won 11 Oscars, the most that is only tied with 'Return of the King' and 'Ben-hur'.There is so much that I love about 'Titanic' that I don't like in most romance movies. The chemistry between the two is amazing. The acting is great, the story is beautiful and emotionally gripping, the visuals are amazing, the epic scope is breath taking and the last hour is breath taking intensity after intensity. The characters are also amazing and the music is just beautiful. Cameron's writing and directing is great despite some cheesy lines such as 'I'm flying!' My main concern with Titanic before watching it was that I believed that Cameron wouldn't be up to the challenge as he is a director of action movies: T2, Aliens, Terminator, The Abyss, True Lies etc. He proved me wrong and I only love Cameron more for this! He has mastered creating epic dramas and epic romances with this movie To conclude this review here, 'Titanic' is an awesome, beautiful and emotionally gripping romance tale that is masterfully directed, brilliantly acted, with amazing visuals, a huge scope, amazing music and some great characters. The movie itself doesn't deserve to be called one of the very best nor in my opinion does it deserve the 11 Oscars it got but 'Titanic' is still....An amazing movie that everyone needs to check out!",9
234,I have no idea why people rated low. This is a pure art of work from Mr. James and team.,8
235,"This is one of the most boring, unexciting, lame, worthless pile of dog heap I have ever seen. I know some overly stimulated people love this film for its emotional romantic story and great acting by 'Leo' and 'Kate' I can't help but feel this is less than rubbish. If this deserved best picture and most successful film of all time, I'm sure The Stupids and Godzilla deserved to be in the AFI Top 100 list. This has no meaning at all, and encourages stupid teens to steal girls from their fiances. I mean, who is the villain here if a poor try-hard gambling artist who seduces rich women and goes into a rich man's car and makes it dirty and makes her think not to marry the man she truly loves and wanted to get married with? That's either a very sick surfer-dude or ONE, DUMB woman. When he dies, he only makes it worse for Kate and basically ruins her life. She has no mother, no husband and no life anymore. It was that S.O.B. who made her live with her daughter in a haystack cabin 80 years later, if DiCrapio wasn't there she would have died happily rich and loved by her family.Yes, James Cameron did a good job wasting his time here, he did probably deserve Responsible for the Biggest Mistake Ever, but he did much better in T2, The Abyss, Aliens and True Lies. Those films actually entertained me. And, Jim, you're NOT the king of the world.The script was wonderful. Glorious is all I can say.""I'll never let go Jack, I'll never let go..."" (Rose lets go of Jack) -audience cries. oh jack. oh jack-""Do you love him?"" ""Pardon me"" ""Do you love him?"" ""None of your business!"" ""It's a simple question."" (Jack stares at Rose very angrily) -audience holds each other's hands, anxiously waiting for an answer-Touching..All in all, Titanic is one overrated pile of nothing which DOES NOT DESERVE its acclaim i'm telling ya. And to all you MEN out there who love this movie, what is this world coming to?",1
236,IMDB needs to take executive action with this rating. 7.8 is criminal. This is the definition of a masterpiece. James Horner steals the show again with the only score more haunting than Braveheart's.,10
237,"James Cameron, the director who brought us horror classics such as ""The Terminator"" and ""Aliens"" suddenly swings around and gives us what is definitely his greatest achievement yet, in a movie that is still quite violent, yet about the exact opposite of his previous films. A love story about two young people from essentially opposite sides of life meeting on board the ill-fated ship RMS Titanic.Our cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio, who launched his career with this film. Academy Award nominee Kate Winslet, along with Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill, David Warner, Billy Zane, and numerous others star in this expansive film that covers nearly every historical detail that is not part of the fictional love story. DiCaprio did very fine in his role, along with Winslet. Gloria Stuart was also very good in her role, though it was a small one.Like all love stories, the film includes romantic scenes which are in my opinion, some of the best produced in film history. We become emotionally attached to the two main characters as they struggle to hold onto each other through the huge disaster the Titanic makes its destructive collision against the iceberg.""Titanic"" made several achievements when it was released. It grossed over a billion dollars and is the highest grossing motion picture worldwide of all time. It also won eleven Academy Awards, one of only three films to do so. It launched the career of Leonard DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. And it is a very good love story. Unfortunately, it is also a movie that a large portion of the crowd hates. It's 7.0 rating on IMDb is unfair. True, it's a three-hour wait to the credits, but I never looked at my watch.",10
238,"This movie has it all - horrible casting, lame dialogue, abysmal acting... What more could you ask for in an award-winning film? The awards I am thinking of, of course, are the Razzies.I wish!I started looking at my watch and squirming within 10 minutes. This film could not end soon enough for me.Besides the above, I was furious that Cameron also tried to revise history and make Rose into a 1990s woman.  A gently raised young lady in that time and that place would a)never have been the only person on board who knew that there were not enough life boats for all the passengers; b)never have heard of ""Mr. Picasso"" and ""Dr. Freud.""  In addition, 3rd class passengers would NEVER (I repeat, NEVER) have been allowed on a 1st class deck, and vice versa.  I also found it insulting that all the poor people were noble and all the rich people (except Rose of course) were evil.I kept thinking about Joe Queenan's comment: ""Sink the damned boat already!"" I never thought I'd find myself rooting for the iceberg.",
239,"I loved the story but felt that Leo De caprio was miss cast he was too young looking to play the part, and Kate Winslet was too mature looking to fall for him, after all we all knew the ending but there was no real sexual chemistry between the pair no bite, and it showed in the film it was a script that any actor could have done because the history of the tragedy sold the film not who appeared in it I personally would have chose, Colin Firth to play the male lead part, don't get me wrong caprio was brilliant in the Mask, beach but he did not suite the Titanic, the special effects were brilliant and educational for history purposes you can't go wrong, because the scene where he draws her naked made you squirm had he seemed too young to be there",7
240,"""Titanic"" is really two movies: one of them is an exciting, James Cameron-style action film, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" with better special effects; the other is a dull as dirt period romance, so simplistic and cliché it seems like something conceived in the mind of a twelve-year-old girl.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet became household names because of their performances in this, and they do invest the film with a great deal of spunk, but they've got absolutely terrible material to work with. Cameron is clearly no writer, but he is a good director of action, so just tune in to this one once the big ship has actually hit the iceberg, and you'll save yourself a lot of time.The supporting cast includes Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, Frances Fisher as Winslet's uptight and aristocratic mother, Victor Garber as the skipper..er...captain, and Billy Zane, in an embarrassingly awful role as the movie's villain. The character as written is like something out of a silent movie, and Zane plays him as such -- if he had a mustache, he'd be twirling it. Too bad his performance is completely at odds with the totally contemporary performances of just about everyone else.Cameron reveals an almost fetishistic obsession with recreating the glamour of the famed ocean liner, and the glee with which he then goes about demolishing it and the people on it borders on the disturbing. It's like watching a little boy build an elaborate train set just so he can have the pleasure of blowing it up with firecrackers.Grade: B",6
241,"Any human being who considers ""Titanic"" to be among the top 250 films of all time should be strapped to a chair in a small room and be forced to watch any Tom Cruise vehicle several hundred times.  In pan 'scan format.Like so many awful Best Picture winners which came before it, ""Titanic"" does a horrible injustice to its so-called intended ""heroes""... in this case, by stereotyping them, making them dispensible.The most recent B.P. winner to have borrowed this technique is Costner's aberration, ""Dances With Wolves,"" which pretended to be about the plight of the Native Americans, whose country we literally stole from them, and turning it into a fable about how one __white__ man rises above his equals to ""appreciate"" the former.  See ""Black Robe,"" ""Little Big Man"" or ""Soldier Blue"" instead.The politically~correct ""Driving Miss Daisy"" suffers the same fate: it should be about Freeman's character, which is infinitely more interesting than Tandy's.""Forrest Gump"" is nearly as insulting, by changing the book in such away as to take the worst of Gump's traits and failings and foisting them on the Robin Wright Penn's ""Jenny"" character, leaving sweet Forrest a saint and Jenny a slut.  ""Pulp Fiction,"" also released in 1994 has already had a greater effect on filmmaking than ""Gump"" ever will.And __that's__ not even Tarantino's best film!Despicable.While we're at it, let's add to this list of garbage which has recently won Best Picture: Mel Gibson's lamentable ""Braveheart,"" which, while sporting excellent large~scale battle scenes, is nearly entirely fictional.More proof that Hollywood's elite still like guys who've paid their dues in front of the camera.""Gandhi""???  Don't even get me started on that Best Costume Design Oscar, let alone its B.P.The trend may have begun in 1939, with the single most overrated flick of all time [""Gone With The Wind"" of course] beating out at least seven better films made in the same year.~Niro",1
242,"Don't wanna bother too much with this one, so I'll give 2 points for the technical part.Ship sinking - good, and so on. As for the rest: childish screenplay,idiotic intrigue,a good-hearted Robin Hood Picasso--DeCaprio in a relationship with Ms.Rich Bitch (I thought this looked like a lesbian relationship, with Winslet being the dominant partner).As for the depiction of the class issue,it reminded me of some Communist propaganda stories.The whole feel of the movie is second-rate sentimentalism.The other characters are incredibly one-sided (Billy Zane looks like a Bond villain and the rich people are the worst bastards I have ever seen).1 billion dollars wasted in a giant corny video-clip.This movie made me sick.As for Celine Dion and her over-hyped song...no comment,except I had no idea that cheesy and corny are the qualities needed for an Oscar-winning song.Now I know. Actors were really alright,but the movie is so melodramatically over the top that it's just insulting....",3
243,"14 years ago I took my then 12 year-old daughter to see a three hour plus film, expecting her to get fidgety: she did not. Neither did I. And now, having seen the movie a number of additional times on a smaller screen, I revisit it on a big screen after a 3D revamp.My first viewing of this movie carried preconceptions with it: I was expecting it to retell the disaster, and I was expecting spectacular eye candy. I got both, and I appreciated that Cameron had chosen a fictitious love story as a vehicle for audience identification to bring home the tragedy on a personal level.On re-watching it 14 years later, I realise that what I'm watching is a romance, played out against the background of the Titanic disaster. I also realise a number of other things: for instance, the groundbreaking computerised extras are no longer as convincing as they were, James Horner's music is great, Cameron's direction is excellent and his writing, despite the occasional clunky bit of dialogue, is very skillful. Oh, and while the performances of the principals are very good, there is some very dodgy work from some of the bit part players.Overall, the verdict is that this film deserved its Oscars. And the 3D conversion has been very successfully carried out, and confirms that Cameron is one of a very small number of directors who truly understands 3D.",10
244,"The only good thing about this movie are the special effects (truly incredible!), including the underwater scenes.  What else does it have? Let's see:One of the worst screenplays ever put on film.One-dimensional, dull, trite characters who are either improbably admirable (our lovely Rose can appreciate Picasso, knows all about Dr. Freud, and can figure out that there aren't enough lifeboats for all the passengers!) or ridiculously evil (Cal, the guy played by Billy Zane).  Not to mention tiresome cliches of the noble poor vs the ignoble rich.Leonardo di Caprio, basically modeling instead of acting.  Kate Winslet doing a more decent job, but nowhere near her performance in ""Sense and Sensibility"" where she was given a real character to play.The only emotion generated by this movie came from knowing that more than 1,200 people actually did die on the Titanic.  And even the disaster scenes weren't nearly as affecting as they should have been -- because the lives and deaths of thousands became merely a backdrop to the romance between Kate and Leo (sorry, Rose and Jack) and the question of whether they would survive.  (Personally, I found myself wishing they had both drowned early in the movie when Rose tried to jump and Jack was going to jump after her.)If you want to see a GOOD movie about the Titanic, rent ""A Night to Remember.""  It was made, I think, in 1948 and obviously had very poor special effects by today's standards, but it did an incomparably superior job of telling the story of the ship and its passengers.  (By the way, the only good bits of dialogue in ""Titanic"" -- the conversations between the crew when they realize the ship is going to sink -- are basically lifted from that film.)  Wisely, ""A Night to Remember"" doesn't focus on a couple of central characters and instead shows us many different people, who are much more fully fleshed out in the small vignettes they get than Jack and Rose were in all those unbearable hours of screen time.  In that way, ""A Night to Remember"" truly captures the human tragedy of what happened.The fact that ""Titanic"" won the Best Picture award in a year that saw such superb films as ""LA Confidential"" and (one of my all-time favorites) ""Boogie Nights"" just shows the cowardice of the Academy and the marketing power of 13-year-old girls.",5
245,"You know, I love disaster movies, and you don't get much bigger a disaster flick than TITANIC, James Cameron's magnum opus, a massively-budgeted and massively award-winning 1997 film that swept the board at the Oscars and has gone down in history as one of the most popular films ever made. Yet I only enjoyed half of it, and that's due to a problematic structure that sacrifices disaster in favour of a cheesy, sappy romance story.Cameron has always been king when it comes to technology and people interacting with it: from his early sci-fi movies to THE ABYSS and AVATAR, he's great at depicting a world where people interact with technology and use it to their advantage. When he focuses on the disaster and sinking of the ship, this is an excellent film with some very impressive special effects that really get across the scale of the disaster.When it comes to human characters, Cameron is a much less assured writer. The romance that plays out here is more unrealistic than in a cheap paperback novel and just as twee. The characters are one-dimensional, from DiCaprio's irritating commoner to Winslet's utterly unbelievable aristocrat who falls in love with him. Their romantic scenes are cringeworthy and as with the other characters they act in very modern days that would have been alien to the era. The less said about the likes of Billy Zane's cardboard cut-out villain the better.In the end, we get a film which spends the entire first hour and a half just plodding around with dumb characters before the disaster strikes, and then things pick up, although there are still lots of cheesy moments and poor dialogue. It's 2/3 romance and 1/3 disaster, and while the disaster stuff is great, the romance is execrable. A NIGHT TO REMEMBER remains the best retelling of the tragedy out there because it focused on the events of the tragedy; I feel Cameron's TITANIC does a disservice to those who lost their lives that night.",5
246,"Say what you will about the gooey love story, but do not contest the film being a masterpiece. Never has a film inspired such emotion in me, such a feeling of belonging to the thrills and struggles of the characters on the screen. The music, a rich blend of instrumental and vocal, is far from archaic. It inspires emotional power that would have otherwise been lost. The story is obviously well-researched, the images are heartbreaking and breathtaking, and, unlike many epics, Titanic is not arrogant, and it does not drag on. In fact, despite its being one of the longest movies I have ever seen, it felt rushed. It was over too soon. It was that good. I did not even think that the love story was that distracting from the grandeur. It was just another human aspect masterfully explored by the film: greed, hate, panic, and, above all, love, a love so profound, so passionate, that it should inspire viewers with envy, not laughter. No, Titanic is as close to flawless as anything can get. With characters that should rightfully be hated and loved, characters to whom we can all relate, a recapture of the world of the past and the ship itself synonymous to a time machine, and a story replete with comedy, tragedy, and thrill, Titanic is a classic that time can never erode, and that shall always inspire laughter and tears.",10
247,"It all starts off with a 100 year old woman named Rose DeWitt Bukater telling her story full of love and loss. The story takes place on the luxurious, but ill-fated R.M.S. Titanic, with young Rose boarding the departed ship with the upper class passengers and her mother. Meanwhile, a traveler and an artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio win third class tickets to the ship in a game of poker. The story explains a seventeen-year-old noblewomen falling in love with a kind, but poor artist.It is a real life story, with a fictional twist. The movie shows two completely different worlds and how they connect, putting aside the labels and showing the purest of love. A great lesson for the real world. Jack and Rose spend their days together experiencing and learning new things from each other. The tale starts off with young Rose convincing herself to jump off of the ship due to her life situation of being forced to marry a self involved man that only loves money and himself. Jack spots young Rose leaning over the rail and tries to convince her saying ""I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain. Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here."" His attempt to help is successful and is invited to a meal as a result of his heroic act.The whole story with the movie is iconic. It has greatly impacted then and is still now. It has made a major impact in the movie industry, and is still evolving. It's a story being told while also being lived at the same time. Now the ship lies at the bottom of the ocean with its remains only able to last another 15 to 20 years, the film is here to keep the memory of the titanic alive. Great success and great things have come out of this movie for many different reasons.I recommend this movie for anyone from teens/young adults to elders. The historic event tying to a beautiful, but fictional story. It's been over 105 years and people are still fascinated with it. So if you are looking to watch a love story that never fails to make you cry, or maybe also a movie with a historic purpose, then I highly recommend watching the Titanic.",10
248,"It isn't that this film is bad.  It would be good if it didn't receive all the hype that it got.  Why in the world would it win Best Picture Oscar. That should have went to L.A. Confidential or As Good As It Gets.  I do enjoy Kathy Bates in everything I see and Kate Winslet was all right.  But James Cameron's cheap theatrics with a false love story aboard the doomed ship was just a way to sell tickets, and adding ""DiCraprio"" was just icing on the cake for him.  If you like good movies, rent ""Boogie Nights"" and if you like a Titanic movie, rent ""A Night to Remember"", please.",
249,"A timeless classic, Titanic combines a moving story, an excellent cast and a beautiful screenplay, set against the greatest shipwreck in the world. Two young people from opposite ends of the social spectrum fall in love aboard the 'unsinkable' Titanic. Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), a lovely and spirited 17-year-old aristocrat, is forced into an engagement with the haughty and controlling Cal Hockley, heir to steel millions, so as to rescue her family's fortunes. Feeling trapped, she decides to jump into the ocean but is stopped by Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). Although poor, Jack is enterprising and courageous and full of fun, and the two quickly fall in love. But Cal will not let things rest, and pursues them doggedly even as the ship is sinking. I like how the movie began in the future, with 102-year-old Rose telling her story to the salvage crew hunting for the famed blue diamond, the Heart of the Ocean. As alluring as treasure is, the listeners are soon captivated by one of the most beautiful love stories ever told. There were so many memorable moments and scenes, from the first half-teasing, half-serious encounter to Jack's parting words to Rose. Everybody should watch this!",10
250,"Romance movies are not my genre.  There I said it, now all you teenage girls (or ex-teenage girls I should probably say) can come with torches to my house and protest.  That said, I think this movie is not only a dud on the technical level, but also on the content plateu.James Cameron loves creating megadose action flicks (Terminator 2, True Lies, etc.) that usually require little background or very uninvolving plots.  The guy has little to no screenwriting ability (if you read his scripts, particularly for ALIENS, you will see that there is nothing to applaud.  Fortunately, as a director, Cameron can transcend the difficulties of putting images on paper and creating some impressive images (even if the scenes themselves are rather dull).By all means, ABYSS and Terminator 2 deserved Oscars for Cinematography, but this movie is merely overrated end-of-the-year garbage (see also CHICAGO) that lacks emotion and style in his camerawork.  Much of his work here in Titanic seems more like he's stealing ideas from Brian DePalma rather than being inventive.Cameron learned from Corman, plain and simple, and that similar attitude is displayed here.  Grabbing a cast from a fashion catalogue, Cameron proves (once again) that he hasn't lost his touch in how to be EXPLOITIVE of human emotion.  That might explain his love life problems.On the rest of the technical notes, this movie did NOT deserve most of the awards it was nominated for.  The Sound is on par with T2 (read: awful) and the effects were unenlightening.  Someone want to explain how Face/Off didn't get that award?  The visual and SFX were fair.  Fair to poor that is, Cameron has lost his ability to know when to use CGI and when not to. Film editing= totally awful, this was waaayy to long even for me.  Hence I fell asleep three times during the sinking.Music= James Horner's score is nothing new. It rather reminded me of ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""Ben-Hur"".  If I had a time machine, I would've given him the Oscar for ALIENS instead.  And as for the Director, what a joke. Now Cameron has become a recluse crackhead rather than therecluse genius he was.So do the math, I have succeeded in knocking off 7 Oscars from this overrated POS.  Now it's on par with Forrest Gump where it belongs. Overall: 1.5 out of 5. Don't waste your time.",
251,"The real history of ""Titanic"" (some of which is touched on in this mess) is a compelling story. While this flick might be ""Romeo and Juliet"" at sea, I found the whole shebang was at sea.The good thing is, ""Titanic"" is full of fine actors. From David Warner to Bernard Fox, right through Jonathan Hyde and even soap star Eric Braeden. The bad thing is, we don't see enough of them.What we get is an awful lot of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. If either of those two (if you'll pardon the pun) ""float your boat"" then you're on easy street. I can't stand either of them and unfortunately what should have been a mawkish subplot is the mawkish major storyline (the ""Trivia"" item that Leonardo's part was offered to Johnny Depp and he declined practically broke my heart). I tried making it through this gargantuan waste of celluloid with the lovers; then I tried fast forwarding through scenes of those two infernal bores . . . and realized I was losing nearly all the movie. There was no escaping them!The movie's major flaw (apart from casting those two simps as the leads) is that the major part of the movie, set in 1912, doesn't really gel with the ""modern"" scenes. Furthermore, not for a moment did I buy Gloria Stuart as an older Kate Winslet. I assume that idea, which was presented up front and so isn't a spoiler, was carried on through the movie. I don't know because I was simply unable to finish watching ""Titanic."" It was BORING. Fortunately I was watching on VHS tapes I picked up for free at a book sale. It was on two tapes and I never bothered putting the second one in. I suppose that's where all the real drama and big effects come in, but the first half was so tedious I saw no reason to bother with the rest. After all, I know what happened to the ship in the end, though I won't reveal it here.It's too bad because I was something of a ""Titanic"" buff in high school. Therefore, I was able to spot little historical errors. I also hate historical movies and tv shows where some familiar actor is introduced briefly as a real person and then the fictional (i.e., phony) story rolls on--in this case, the affair between Leonardo and Kate.Perhaps it's a curse, but no really good movie has been made about ""Titanic."" the one with Clifton Webb was too soap operaish and had a silly ending. The one with Kenneth More tried to be fairly accurate with information known at the time (now all blown to bits by the discovery of the ship itself). This one is not really about ""Titanic."" It's about the love story, and is worthy of any 1970s disaster movie. It could be set on the Poseidon, in a Towering Inferno, or on Krakatoa. All I know is, it seemed to go on and on and on until little bits of me started dropping off. If I'd been on ""Titanic"" with those two I'd have gone down with the ship.Perhaps people were drawn to this the same way they were to the practically endless ""Doctor Zhivago"" in the 1960s, for a fiery love story (at that time) set against a great historical backdrop. Too bad Omar Sharif wasn't the lover in this one. At least he's always been good for a few laughs. But Kate Winslet is no Julie Christie. And why should she be? She was bad enough in ""Hamlet.""Overall, this must be the most overrated monster in the history of the talkies. It was supposed to be about the tragedy of ""Titanic"" with all its needlessly lost lives, yet I was reminded of the line of Oscar Wilde about a work of Dickens: ""One must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell without laughing."" But ""Titanic"" doesn't even have enough hoots in it to make it as watchable as ""Plan Nine from Outer Space."" Just because something is popular doesn't make it good.",3
252,"I understand why every Dick and Jane on the planet liked this, but why did the critics give it such good reviews? I mean, it is not, contrary to popular opinion, the worst movie ever made (although, yes, it may be the most overhyped, although The Matrix and Star Wars: Episode 1 are huge contenders). It is merely bad. There are very few things to like in this film. Technically, it succeeds to a point. I really did believe that I was watching a real ship sink (well, since the model built by Cameron for the film was just barely a model and more a full-sized ship, it ought to look real!). Some of the CGI was terrible, though. The people falling from the boat were so obviously digitally created that I laughed a bit. The writing is extraordinarily weak. Dialogue is just as bad. Everything that happened in the film, which takes over 3 hours, can easily be related on a cocktail napkin. The worst part about it has to be the acting. Kate Winslet has actually been good, elsewhere, but here she has nothing to work with. DiCaprio is bad. There's no saving him - his career, much like that of a boy band, is going down the toilet as I type (he's starting to gain weight and get greasy like Marlon Brando did - this sort of right is only reserved for actors of Brando's status, so stop it now, Leo!). Billy Zane is awful, too, but it is mostly that his part is so insubstantial.So do you believe in payolas? It's beginning to make me curious that such obviously bad films as Titanic, American Pie, and The Matrix all got rave reviews from critics. All three of the films were abominations. And you may ask, what does it matter if a critic reviews it well? I don't care about their opinion! Not true, my friend. Even if your insecurities tell you that critics are unimportant, you always secretly feel victory when the consensus is for a film you really like. Therefore, there are no guilty feelings after you have enjoyed something like Titanic so much. Instead, you feel for a fading second that, yes, you are part of high culture. You understand art. BLAH! It's all just sinister psychology working its claws over simple minds.And for those of you who absolutely despise this film, I can guess your favorite pictures: Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Fight Club, and, of course, The Matrix. Well, you people should actually begin to learn what REAL film is. Rent A Night to Remember, the best film about the Titanic's sinking. It is not the greatest film ever made, but it is great.",4
253,"oh my god this movie is awful i hate this movie one of the worst movies what the world has ever produced and of course the worst soundtrack ever ""my heart will go on"" Celine Dion big crap. it must be a epic but it's a piece of crap.Titanic,the ship of dreams i say titanic the ship of crap.i don't i hate people who dead in 1912.but titanic is crap.it's silly and overrated.i don't understand why this crap won 11 Oscars why?it's so boring movie.i didn't even liked the acting it was too hammy.James Cameron is not bad director,but this is black piece to his movies.so i don't recommend it to anyone.watch something else.maybe a lot of people love this movie but i hate this movie. 1.5/10",1
254,James Cameron doesn't do what James Cameron does for James Cameron...James Cameron does what James Cameron does because James Cameron IS James Cameron.Oh and this film is flawless.,10
255,"The featured review of this film carries the line ""the scene shifts to Southampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912"" A minor point perhaps, to our american friends but Southampton is in England. Still, i only partly put that glaring error down to the unfortunate american who wrote it. After seeing Titanic i would have got the impression Southampton is in Ireland too. The ship was built in Belfast which was British then and is British now, so to make up for that and appease the Irish American audience they fill the ship with poor unfortunates from the emerald isle whose only role in the film seems to be getting screwed by the English ""tyrants"" who run the ship. Add a few poor but heroic Americans to the mix and you've got a blockbuster. To be fair, i hate this type of film anyway so it was never going to get a good review from me. 2 / 10",1
256,well this movie blows everything literally out of the water basically its 3hrs of epic partitions of James Cameron all time tearjerker that surprised every one in the cinema that lasted 12months what a film showing the heart of the ocean following the story of an old lady who fell in love when young her heart was with jack and she never let go even though she married some one else jack and rose were separated by a social class she was caught in between but as faith would have it the would meet for a brief but amazing romance only to be halted by ice this tear jerker would have you crying from beginning to end its such a a epic film ten out of ten great acting it deserved its 11 Oscars the determination and courageous people who died in the titanic shows through in making this movie and the actors in this film you can see some of them wanted to help the people in the water but all were frozen only few survived what a shock that titanic went down and celine dion song made this film soundtrack amazing spectale,10
257,"Well.... the British people made their decision, we must respect that result. I'm so sad and heartbroken. This film represents the fall of Great Britain in the years ahead, Titanic was a British ship and had everything going for it, until it hit an iceberg after being manipulated by people only interested in money and power. The same thing is happening to Britain now and it won't be long until Britain hits that iceberg. I'm sorry I couldn't serve the country I love and every time this film is on I play the violin and weep tears of sorrow because I failed my beautiful country. The acting in the film was top notch, as were the special effects and the dialogue. However the sheer sadness of the film, all those lives lost and also the way it kinda predicts the future deeply saddens me and makes me suicidal every time I see it and for that reason I can't give it more than 8 stars. I would've given it 9 stars before the referendum but now it's 8 stars. May those that died on the Titanic rest in peace.",8
258,"It is the best movie ever made , the directing ,the music, the acting, the love story, the real events , everything is FLAWLESS, and how can u not fall in love with Jack Dawson AKA Leonardo DiCaprio best role ever , the movie tells everything about the sad tragic incident of the RMS TITANIC , it was the first movie i watch at theater when it 1st came out , i was 7 yearsold , I was fascinated ,i have watched it 100 times & still cry every time its do touching and amazing , good job director James Cameron thank u for this masterpiece",10
259,"A seventeen-year-old aristocrat (Kate Winslet), expecting to be married to a rich claimant (Billy Zane) by her mother, falls in love with a kind but poor artist (Leonardo DiCaprio) aboard the luxurious, ill-fated R.M.S. Titanic.The first thing that is really striking about this film is that it came from James Cameron, who is much better known for science fiction films like ""Terminator"", ""Avatar"" and ""Aliens"". He is not the first person that comes to mind when you think of historical fiction romances. And yet, he nailed it. ""Titanic"", despite its length of three hours, was a huge success and may have sold more VHS copies than any other movie.But beyond the romance, this is actually a rather decent movie. I cannot say why, it is something hard to put one's finger on. Most likely, it has something to do with Billy Zane, who is more or less the greatest thing about the film.",7
260,"Titanic is an over-hyped, over-rated piece of garbage. It goes an hour too long and winds on for what seems like decades. The plot is a poorly written, romantic piece of rubbish and the performances by DeCaprio and Winslet are mediocre. However, Billy Zane and Kathy Bates bring some some hope to the non-existent story line. Putting the plot and acting aside, Titanic is a technical milestone. The sequences where the Titanic sinks are nothing short of mind-blowing and you would think you are on the ship. It is lucky that the sinking of the ship is so brilliant, because after the length of time the viewer has to wait, it is much deserved. All in all, this is a movie that should have sunk in an hour and a half.",7
261,Titanic has got to be the best film off ALL time. Everything about the film is amazing. James Cameron did a wonderful job (as usual) at directing and Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet are truly wonderful. The music is beautiful too. (BRILLIANT soundtrack.) Like i have already said Titanic is amazing and it will always stay that way. 20/10,10
262,My goodness. Definitely BN in my top 3 movies of all time. Perfect blend of romance and disaster. They don't make movies like this anymore.,10
263,First time I cry in a movie. Well executed all around.,10
264,"It certainly has its flaws. Mainly in dialogue (occasionally) but this film is wildly entertaining and thus being a 3 hour movie it doesn't really stagger. You feel the true journey of the ship and not just it's final moments above water. Leo and Kate are great in this. King Kathy bates is also perfect. The set, costumes, make up, music, visuals/cinematography, directing all wonderful. It's a great classic film that presents itself as powerful as the ship appeared to be. Even though the ending isn't what a Leo fan girl wants it does allow you to feel more of what the survivors feel wondering if their loved ones survived or if they knew they hadn't. James Cameron is always ambitious with his films but this one is distinguishing. Not the best love story ever but defiantly an iconic one. Knowing how much time and love James Cameron put into making this film and researching it makes you appreciate the film so much more.",10
265,"This may contain spoilers...... OK just a little bit of background to this review. Firstly, yes I was one of that 0.01% who did not see this movie at the cinemas when it came out. Secondly, when I did see it for the first time on TV last year, I missed the first 45 minutes. However, I saw enough of this movie to see how ridiculously over-rated it was. Firstly, the positives, and there weren't a whole lot. Number one: yes, the special effects were as good as they were supposed to be. The design of the Titanic was amazing. Also the bit at the end where the ship sinks was incredible. Number two: Kate Winslet has a nice body, and you do get to see a lot more of it than I thought you would...... although one could be a bit cynical about that scene, that they only put it in to get more people to watch it. That's about it for the positives. Now for the negatives: Leonardo Di Caprio can't really act. OK, I thought he did well in Romeo and Juliet (which is one of my favorite movies) but his acting and dialog are just really wooden in Titanic. The characters as a whole are just one-dimensional. One of the most laughable points was though how many life-or-death situations there are for Leo and Kate in the last hour (yes, the movie takes forever to finish). First Leonardo gets locked down below deck as the water level slowly rises (ooh will he survive????) and of course gets rescued by Kate Winslet after about 15 minutes. Then Kate's evil fiancée (yes not much room for development in that character) starts shooting at them so they have to run back 5 levels deep before deciding to go back on top. Here they face a literal ""class barrier"" (big metaphor there of course) a big iron gate, which, with help from the other battling workers, Leonardo bravely breaks down. Forgive my sarcasm, but it was hard not to roll my eyes throughout this whole sequence. Then after narrowly surviving half a dozen near-death experiences, Leonardo dies in the lamest way possible. Instead of attempting to find another piece of debris to float on in the water, he rather unnecessarily lets winslet have the whole piece of wood to float on, and lets himself freeze to death. But perhaps the worst part of all was the sequences where we go back to the old 101-year old version of Kate Winslet telling the story, with a bunch of young scientists passing social commentary on it. I've always hated this idea, because it gives away the ending of the film. The viewer knows that she will survive, and Leonardo won't. Which sort of takes away from any of the suspense. Anyhow, I would recommend this movie to anyone (not that you haven't seen it already) but go in with a low expectation and you might find it a decent film. Certainly don't watch it, though, expecting to see a film that deserved 11 Oscars, cos you will be disappointed.",3
266,"Yes, for a long time, I did avoid this one. Eventually, I realized that I had to; Cameron is talented enough to make this work. I've now seen every film he's directed, save for Piranha Part II(which I understand was taken away from him), and the man always does a nice job. No, not every single picture of his is excellent... but they're all worth the time(and with hardly any exceptions(and this certainly isn't one), the investment of emotions from the audience, as well), they entertain and he's yet to make the exact same thing twice(Terminator 2 is different from the original in notable areas, such as the tone). I don't blindly love all of them; I maintain that the quality of The Abyss lies mainly in the gorgeous under-water photography. He never phones it in, and he always has something to say, somewhere to go with what he does. I was apprehensive of the idea that this would focus on a small group of people(in particular, the two leads), when this was indeed something that actually did happen, and many were killed. However, when you think about it, it needed to be like that; that's what makes the incident(in this) have the devastating impact that I think we can all admit it does. Yes, the FX are amazing, and the production values offer a new definition of the term ""grandiose"" when applied to that aspect; the reason we ""feel"" it, though, is that we care about the ones we ""know"" to be on the ship. The characters are well-written, thoroughly developed, credible and all have something to do. Rose is a rather strong woman, and without it reaching anachronistic levels, either. She is not ""just a wife"", and she is fleshed out, something that many attempts at female role models neglect to do. The cast is spot-on, everyone is well-chosen. Every single acting performance is flawless. Arguably, this is somewhat black and white in its presentation of them; with that said, they are all convincing and have genuine personality. This is one of the greatest disaster movies, and epic love dramas, in the world of cinema. It is Hollywood and mainstream at its absolute best. Will it please everyone? Perhaps not, and probably not those who refuse to take it on its own terms. It was always clear what approach this took. And also, about hype... ignore it. Yes, you read that right. In this case and in all others, pretend like you can't hear what everyone is making something out to be, and watch what you feel like, as unaffected by popular opinion as you can be. Nothing can survive a viewing by someone who has heard nothing other than positives about it, regardless of its quality. The pacing is marvelous; for a running time of three hours, this is not boring at all. It has fun and humorous moments. Is it sappy? I suppose that's up to the individual to judge; I wouldn't say so. There is a bit of violence and disturbing content, infrequent mild to moderate language, a little sexuality(hinted at) and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to everyone. 10/10",10
267,"Titanic is a fair work from director James Cameron. Sometimes being called on the carpet for it's naive plot and dialogue, this movie had the rare merit of reuniting the public and the critics in an unanimous way: James Cameron's Titanic is an effective work to be remembered. This does not happen so often. For several weeks, this movie had the privilege to score brilliantly on the top charts, as well as conquering major movie awards around the world. Is it fair? Was it overrated? That does not matter, if we accept it for what it stands. It worked perfectly. The artwork is ostentatious and the acting if not perfect is adequate and balanced with the strength of the script written by Cameron himself. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the necessary honesty to the role, while Kate Winslet grants the wit, elegance and grace that a romantic and troubled heroin should have. Miss Winslet was without any doubt the finest actress for the role. Apart from the supremacy of the visual effects, which are the main core of this movie for most of its viewers, Titanic dazzles for the truth and sensibility present in every single detail in every scene. More than a parade of mere flash-backs from an old lady who once was ""a dish"", this movie is a fine drama made with a solid sense of loyalty and respect for the viewer. You know what happens before you pay for your ticket. You know it is a love story set on a transatlatic and you know people will die. What matters, most of all, is the possibility Cameron gives you to imagine what might have been if you had the chance to find true love under the most ungrateful circumstances. 8 out of 10 for Cameron's sensibility and courage to write a story without having any previous experience as a screen-writer; 10/10 for a brilliant Kate Winslet, a beautiful and talented British actress who proved that acting skills do not have nationality nor beauty patterns. I had fun watching it. It made me feel like I was sharing the inner conflicts felt by the main characters. For its truth and audacity to tell a story already told a thousand times, I bow with respect.9/10",9
268,"Titanic, for many of us, maybe one of the great films ever made, I beg to differ. Seeing this movie for the first time did not really gave me the intense and impact as it did on millions and millions of us. To be honest, I find this movie boring and really a waste of more than 3 hours.The story is so much predictable. You can even guess what would happen, and even what's the ending. Performances, I must admit, are quite impressing. Billy Zane and Kathy Bates delivers a stand-out performances. Leonardo and Kate, also did well on this film, but truly neither of them deserves an Oscar. James Cameron, as far directing is concern, really deserves his Oscar. Effects on this film are also great, especially when the ship is sinking, but most of the time I find it lame. To sum up, this film has its own highlights, but truly I don't consider this as one of the greatest films.",
269,"Pure glop. Wooden acting. Astonishingly unconvincing characters. Boring, generic music (descending to banality in the case of ""My Heart Will Go On""). Good sets and effects (no surprise, considering how much money was spent on them). Overall, the cinematic equivalent of a Big Mac, but even more tasteless.The first time I watched ""Titanic,"" I lasted 20 minutes. ""I'm going upstairs to read,"" I told my wife. ""Call me when it starts to sink."" The sinking was lots of fun (that, and the effects, are why I rate it a 2 instead of a 1), but not enough to counteract three hours of turgid, sentimental ooze. If the film had BEGUN with the sinking scene, it would rate a 10.I did watch it again, in its entirety, and that's three and a quarter hours of my life that I will never get back.",2
270,"TITANIC ( rating * * out of 5 )I fear I'm about to make myself highly unpopular with what follows, but I can only call 'em as I see 'em. Besides, being highly unpopular is such familiar territory for me and it just wouldn't be the same without the constant slings and pointed arrows.From writer/director James (I'm king of the world) Cameron, comes this 200 million dollar purported epic that in my view only ever reaches the status of cubic zirconia.But never fear, Hollywood will incestuously look after its own because any movie that costs the amount that could pull a third world South American country out of insolvency and destitution, is guaranteed to win eleven Academy Awards - Oscars for categories like, The Most Times Actors Say, ""No! This Way."" - The Most Soggy Extras and The Best Motion Picture Where The Male Lead Is Snubbed For A Nomination.This unfortunate male lead is none other than Leonardo Di Caprio who possesses all the rugged good-looks of a fourteen year old pimple-cream model. But it's not all bad news for Leo because he has perfected the art of being a pipsqueak while painting chubby actresses in the nude - poor old Kate Winslet's dress was so tight around the torso that the hunky Leo had to use solvent to get it off.Rose DeWitt (Kate Winslet), is engaged to the jerk millionaire, Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). Cal gives her a priceless necklace that has some significance later on as a wrinkly Rose tells the story which is seen in flashback.Anyway, Rose meets Jack (Leonardo Di Caprio), as she attempts suicide and the couple are instantly attracted (in Rose's case, as much as someone who is attempting suicide can be). The pair eventually fall in love, the ship hits an iceberg, the ship sinks, the ship becomes famous and we are subjected to this hideously expensive, self-important and time-consuming movie (I had to pause halfway through to bake some muffins as not to suffer the effects of malnutrition).However, I did give this movie two stars and that was for the special effects. To be fair, they were pretty good. As a mass of brave stunt-personnel tumbled into the icy water, I did get the sense of what the chaos and hysteria must have been like on that fateful night in 1912 - reminiscent of lunch-time crowds around the all-you-can-eat desert bar at Sizzler.In a nutshell, this film is a love story between Jack and Rose that never rises above soap-opera melodramatics. After an hour and a half of this kissy kissy nonsense, I found myself participating in open prayer thanking the Almighty for his very timely iceberg.What possibly could warrant so much money and effort? Certainly not a piece of Hollywood trivia that tells us nothing about the Titanic that we didn't already know.If I've missed the point, then to all of you 'Titanic' devotees I sincerely apologize. But, if I'm right, then you have all been the victims of Hollywood and its intricate network of propaganda.",
271,"James Cameron's Titanic holds up very well indeed after more than ten years since initial release. The minuses now are the same as then but they are minor in comparison to the plusses. First of all, the Titanic is one of the grandest tragedies of human history. The highest and mightiest could tumble. It was an analogy to the state of the world, almost like a foreshadowing of the First World War when all that seemed eternal disintegrated with spectacular suddenness.Cameron approaches the task primarily as a hardware technician. The ship looks the way it has to look - grandiose, solid, lavishly appointed. The physical details are spot on, down to the last piece of china. This all helps. The use of CGI during the prolonged sinking is largely state of the art even now.The idea of putting a story of young lovers at the center of the film is a sound, if trite, way to give us the universal through the particular. The film would have been just as gripping if Cameron had chosen a more Altmanesque approach whereby a whole group of characters would be given more or less equal weight as they made their way to journey's end. Here the focus is on the teenage couple: unhappy rich girl (Kate Winslet) and working-class bohemian artiste (Leonardo DiCaprio). The problem with these usually fine actors is that too often their youthful brio seems forced, as if Cameron as director/screenwriter is straining to point out their youth, their vitality, their exuberance, in contrast to Winslet's stuffy social set which disapproves of their alliance. The best acting comes from Billy Zane as the arrogant, sadistic, petulant fiancé of Winslet who stops at nothing to separate her from unwashed upstart DiCaprio. Zane gets it all right, including the clipped prep school accent which barely conceals his primal, frustrated rage at being trumped by someone from the lower classes. DiCaprio comes across as a modern suburban high school student playing a street urchin in a drama class presentation. There is no real edge to him. In fact, if the casting had been reversed it would have made much more sense. But DiCaprio's youth, looks and agility carry him through the spectacle. Besides, we don't go to spectacles for acting nuance.Cameron's script isn't as dreadful as some claim, but it has significant shortcomings. (Screenwriting was the only major category in which Titanic was not nominated for an Oscar - and for good reason.) A bit of working over by a competent script doctor would have made it truer. Amazingly, considering Cameron himself has some background in visual arts, the situations and dialogue touching on questions of painting are embarrassingly unimaginative and superficial. And much of the banter between Winslet and DiCaprio sounds late 20th century, not 1912. The conflict between the haughty first-class passengers and those beneath them is perhaps overdone. Frances Fisher is touching as Winslet's socially striving mother for whom we feel both pity and contempt as she pushes her daughter into marriage with a soulless brute. Gloria Stuart as Kate Winslet grown old and Victor Garber as the ship's designer who sees his master creation ripped asunder also stand out. And some of the dinner table conversation in the first-class dining room is elegant and witty.One implausibility: The water temperature of the sea in which the Titanic sank was just above freezing. No human, save an Olympic athlete, or at least the young and vigorous, could have survived more than a few minutes in waters of that temperature. Survivors relate that the screaming of the passengers who landed in the water when the ship sank subsided after only a few minutes. None could survive the water. Yet Kate Winslet is seen wading neck deep in this ice bath for minutes on end as she struggles to rescue DiCaprio who has been handcuffed to steam pipes in a lower-level cabin. Then the two proceed through endless corridors of freezing water to the deck where they continue on, fighting their way through panicked crowds, breaking down barriers, leaping and scaling heights, etc. until they finally go down with the ship into the freezing sea where they survive for endless minutes more as they as they cling to debris.A CGI flaw: Just as false, occasionally Cameron's keyboard tappers and mouse movers add little puffs of computer-generated condensed breath to accompany the exhalations of actors in close up. Problem is, only intermittently does this condensation appear. One moment you see it, another moment it's gone.The interminable lovey-dovey blatherings between Winslet and DiCaprio as they float in the ice water quickly wear thin. Perhaps pre-teen girls (a major component of this film's box office) would be transfixed by this interlude, but surely most adults would be yearning for DiCaprio's character to die and get it over with.And even more dreadful than everything cited above is the treacly ""Our Love Will Go On,"" a pop song belted by Celine Dion over the closing credits. I am sick and tired of contemporary pop songs being tacked on to historical dramas.Finally, the ultimate film to see on this subject is ""Titanic: The Legend Lives On"" (1994), a fascinating and moving 4-hour-plus Arts & Entertainment Channel documentary about the Titanic from conception through construction through destruction, aftermath and cultural/historical legacy. More emotionally involving and fascinating than Cameron's movie. It will stay with you for a long time.",8
272,"It was brave of James Cameron to attempt an undertaking on this scale. Making the world's most expensive movie ever is always to tempt fate; the film which had previously held that distinction, the Kevin Costner vanity project ""Waterworld"", had been a disaster in both financial and artistic terms. Even before ""Titanic"" was finished, rumours were circulating that it would be equally disastrous; the critics began preparing their ""sinking ship"" metaphors in anticipation of its failure.In the event, of course, the critics were confounded; the film was a great success, both at the box office and with the Academy, who awarded it eleven Oscars including best picture and best director. It became the most talked-about film of 1997. Eight years on there have been other films on a similar epic scale and some of the excitement it provoked has died away. Nevertheless, even today it stands out as a fine achievement.""Titanic"" combines two quite different genres, the disaster movie and the ""heritage"" costume drama. The late nineties saw a modest revival of the disaster picture, that quintessentially seventies genre, with ""Twister"" in 1996 and ""Dante's Peak"" and ""Volcano"" the following year. Cameron took the basic formula for such films and applied it to a real historical event, making a film on a grand scale with lavish attention to period detail. The real Titanic sinking had a number of features which fitted the genre; it is something of a convention of disaster movies that the disaster should be caused, or at least exacerbated, by the incompetence or complacency of those in authority, an element emphasised here. Bruce Ismay, the Chairman of the White Star Line, proudly proclaims the ship unsinkable, then causes the disaster by urging the captain to steam at top speed through an ice-field. To make matters worse, the company have neglected to provide sufficient lifeboats for all on board.Cameron also imported into the film some of the conventions of ""heritage cinema"". That genre has often been used to examine the British class system, often in films which feature romances between individuals from different social backgrounds, such as Losey's ""The Go-Between"" or Merchant-Ivory productions like ""Howard's End"". Cameron takes the same concept and uses the film to examine the historical roots of the American class system, of which the ship, with its first, second and third class passengers, is a microcosm. Intertwined with the story of the tragedy is the story of the romance between Rose Dewitt Bukater, daughter of an aristocratic Philadelphia family, and Jack Dawson, a struggling artist from a working-class background.The America that we see is not, as is sometimes said, a classless society, nor even one where class is solely determined by wealth. The Dewitt Bukaters, for all their old-money pretensions, are in financial difficulties, and Rose's late father died heavily in debt. Rose's mother Ruth sees that the only way to maintain the family's social status will be if Rose makes a ""good"" marriage to a wealthy man, and a seemingly ideal candidate has presented himself in the shape of Cal Hockley, the son of a nouveau-riche industrialist. Unfortunately, Cal is an arrogant, selfish snob, and Rose cannot bear the thought of marriage to him. She considers suicide by throwing herself off the ship, but is dissuaded from doing so by Jack, and the two fall in love.Some have criticised the film for concentrating on the romance of Jack and Rose, arguing that this focus is somehow demeaning to a real-life tragedy in which over a thousand people died. This is not a criticism with which I would agree. It would clearly have been impossible to tell the personal stories of all those who died; Cameron's aim was to put the disaster into context and heighten its impact by giving us two characters we can care about and to make their story representative of the stories of all those caught up in the drama, thus heightening the film's emotional impact.The film has a number of weaknesses. The liberties taken with historical accuracy, such as the denigration of the character of William Murdoch (who in real life died bravely), can sometimes seem offensive. The opening scenes and closing, which deal with the attempts of a modern salvage team to recover from the wreck a valuable jewel given by Cal to Rose, were possibly unnecessary and certainly overlong, and could easily have been pruned. The acting is not always very good; I was less than impressed by Leonardo Di Caprio as Jack. (In fairness it must be said that he has greatly improved as an actor since 1997, having given a good performance in ""Catch Me If You Can"" and an excellent one in ""The Aviator""). Kate Winslet as Rose was better, although even she fell short of the brilliance she had shown in ""Heavenly Creatures"".The weaknesses are, however, greatly outweighed by the film's strengths. A special mention must go to James Horner's evocative score and Celine Dion's song ""My Heart Will Go On"". There are a number of good performances in minor roles, from Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, shunned as vulgar by her fellow first-class passengers but more good-hearted than any of them, Bernard Hill as Captain Smith, a decent man but without the strength of character to stand up to Ismay's bullying, and Frances Fisher as Ruth, a woman who puts her social status ahead of her daughter's happiness. In the end, however, this is not a film one watches for the acting. I would agree with the reviewer who said that the real star is neither Kate nor Leo but rather the great ship itself, particularly during the spectacular scenes after it hits the iceberg. The success of ""Titanic"" gave Hollywood back the self-confidence to make pictures on a grand scale with daring, energy and imagination, leading to recent epics such as ""Gladiator"" and ""Troy"". 8/10",8
273,When I watched Jack die I literally began to cry because I knew that I would never see something as funny as that.  It was sentimental and it warmed many peoples' hearts.  You actually think that this movie is so funny and fake that you can't bear it and then you get to see his lifeless body frozen in the water.  The only thing that could have made this movie better is if Old Rose had been thrown into the water or killed and eaten.  If you like this I suggest you rent The Texas Chainsaw Massacre... the movie is not quite as graphic or shocking but you will also like it.,1
274,"Despite Cameron's showboating at the Academy Awards, this is simply a bombastic mess. His first mistake was to take on too many roles, and crucially, that of screenwriter. What flimsy story he concocted to precede the disaster is rife with bad dialog and the most tired stereotypes imaginable. Take a look at the ""Goofs"" page here, too. You would think they could have done much better; sloppy work for one of the most expensive films ever made.I felt like shouting at the screen at times: are you kidding? They spend how many minutes of the film in bone-chilling water and aren't even shivering just a little bit after getting out? (The water temperature would have to be about, what, 30 degrees? After all, there's icebergs floating in it! They would have been hypothermic within minutes, and dead after a few more.) And he gets the Best Director Award for such atrocious work? (The Man Who Would Be King of the World, indeed!)Billy Wilder tersely summed it up in one of his interviews with Cameron Crowe: ""Have you ever seen such horse**** in your life?""",1
275,"I've seen quite a lot of movies in my life, but ""Titanic"" stands alone.  It is the most amazing, beautiful, heartbreaking movie ever made.  The final scene broke my heart into a thousand pieces.  I love this movie very much and always will.",10
276,"The acting, the plot, the soundtrack, etc. Everything is so great and finesse!",10
277,"This is an epic tragedy movie about aristocrat Rose DeWitt Bukater falling in love with poor artist Jack Dawson, aboard the doomed Titanic. It is a beautiful but typical love story that captures the audience's hearts, providing a compelling subplot among the more tragic main story of the ill-fated voyage.Many of the movie's element was directed with excellence: the actors provided a solid and believable performance; the cinematography was beautiful; the music score was moving; and the sceneries and settings aboard the ship, amidst the flashy and famed lifestyles of aristocracy and amidst the poor but carefree lives of the townspeople and artists, were brilliant.The scenes of each character's fate after the Titanic started sinking is extremely powerful, haunting, and sometimes disturbing. The film quickly shifts from an emotional love story, which I thought was, unfortunately, pretty boring, to a heart-wrenching tragedy that cannot help but send chills down your spine (where most of the action lies).This movie is a little on the long side though, with several filler scenes that drag away from the main plot. Some sequences of Jack and Rose were pretty cliché - reminding you too much of a teenage-bop love story. While I am not a big drama fan, this movie is a good exception for pure, dramatic entertainment, but not one I would watch over and over again.Grade C",6
278,"So, I had not seen Tiatnic for like 7 years.I remember the last time I saw it I was about 7 or 8 years old. Since, then, I have not seen it. I remember that at the end, when Jack dies, and Rose is left in the ocean that I cried a lot. A lot of people surely cried. In the last year, I have started to use IMDb, and I see Titanic gets a lot of hate. Well, I decided to see it again to refresh my memory.Let me start off by saying that Titanic gets a lot of hate because of its weak screenplay. Yes, the screenplay is the biggest problem. No, it is not horrible, but there are a lot of cheesy and badly written lines. Some scenes are very unrealistic(like Jack grabbing Rose when she slips in her red dress with only his hand). Also, like when Rose and Jack start to run away from water. Scenes like this make the film look bad, and some lines and dialogue seem unnecessary and poor. BUT let me tell you, that if Titanic wanted to give some emotion to its audience, then in that way, it does not disappoint or fail. The chemistry between Rose and Jack(played beautifully by Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio) is strong. Their love seems real, even though at times it feels too forced, and the way they met is unrealistic. BUT in having a romance story together with a real life tragic, it is done very well. The production design is very well done. The ship and the effects(i am sorry for saying the effects were bad, after seeing it all, they were not), well, they are magnificent. All the stuntmen and the effects done in the actual sinking of the ship is simply amazing. The last hour of the film is so intense, and it looks so realistic, visually, that you can't help but love it for that. Some scenes are so monumental, they are some of the most tragically horrifying scenes in cinema history. The costumes are also well done, for the period of 1912.Another great aspect of the film was the acting. Kate Winslet deserved her Oscar nomination, as did Gloria Stuart. All the actors were on par. The music in the film is simply heartbreaking, The original song by Celine Dion is just WOW. One of the best songs in film history, and its Oscar win is very well deserved. The direction is simply inspiring.Titanic as a whole is satisfying for every film lover. For people who like to be entertained, this is a great film for them, because even though it has some problems, it never fails to entertain, or to emotionally connect with. Yes, this film gets a lot of hate, but the honest truth, is, Titanic is a Masterpiece of its time. i am sure that it will be remembered in 50 years, simple because of how well a film it is. Yes, problems or not, the fictional film about two lovers in a doomed ship just has to be remembered, whether people want it to or not. 10/10",
279,"Okay, um, tell me again, what is so good about this movie???????? How did it win best picture next to ""Good Will Hunting?"" Why does everyone obsess over Leonardo DiCaprio?? I didn't even cry at ""Titanic."" Now, I am a girl, but have only seen this movie once. And almost every single one of my friends loves ""Titanic,"" bawled their eyes out at the end, and adores Leonardo DiCaprio & Co. Me? I think ""Armageddon"" is sadder than this movie. (I nearly cried at that one) All I hear is ""Titanic this,"" or ""Titanic that."" I'm sick of it! I have to admit the special effects and set designs are good, but this is just Romeo & Juliet set in 1915. I guess I just didn't ""feel the romance."" I'm not an unemotional person, but I've seen movies a lot more moving (and entertaining) than ""Titanic"". I almost *want* ""The Phantom Menace"" to beat its highest box office gross record. :-) If you haven't seen ""Titanic,"" don't take everyone's word for it if they say it's the greatest movie on earth, okay?? Thanks.-2001Rulz",
280,"Titanic (1997) is a movie I recently watched on Netflix. The storyline follows a missing rare diamond that was a necklace thought to be lost when the Titanic sank. When a picture is discovered that includes a woman wearing the diamond, a news flash stretches the globe. A woman steps forward claiming to be the woman from the photo with a tremendous story to tell...This movie was directed by James Cameron (Terminator 2) and stars Leonardo DiCaprio (The Departed), Kate Winslet (Revolutionary Road), Billy Zane (Back to the Future II), Kathy Bates (Misery), Bill Paxton (Frailty), Victor Garber (Argo), David Warner (Tron) and Frances Fisher (Unforgiven).The details in the writing from beginning to end in this is absolutely magnificent. There's so much depth to every aspect of this movie. You get lost in the magnificence of the ship in this movie, but also in the characters within the storyline. This is really a unique setting and set of circumstances to depict a love story. The backstory of each character is well developed as well as their current state circumstances and perspectives. The sound track is perfection and fit the film perfectly. Once the ship hits the iceberg the movie gets intense quickly and depicts those circumstances in depth as well. The conclusion isn't storybook but still excellent and worthwhile.This is American cinematic gold and an absolute masterpiece. I would easily score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10
281,"This is truly one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has so many little details that relate to the actual history about it. Even some of the things people say relates right to what actually happened. It does have some minor flaws like how the ship is built, but other than that, I thought it was fairly accurate.Also, the director really connects you with the characters. With Rose, you feel bad for her that she is forced to marry this terrible man and with Jack, you feel bad for him because he keeps getting stereotyped into a ""poor man."" You can tell that they have such a connection right away as well. Towards the beginning, when Rose is on the railing of the ship, Jack comes in and saves her, which brings them closer together. They have an unbreakable bond. At some points in the film, I did get a little teary-eyed from how Rose was treated by her fiancé and mother. It was so unfair that she could never make her own decisions. The same goes with Jack too, when Rose's fiancé and mother would discriminate him because he didn't have nearly as much in his pocket. These examples help you grow fond of the characters and help you feel what they feel.This film is fairly historically accurate and a timeless classic.",9
282,"Titanic and Avatar are very different. One is about a forbidden love aboard a doomed ship. The other is about humans trying to exploit an alien race in order to profit. Yet both have something very similar in common: they are criticized for having unoriginal stories.Titanic is a love story about a doomed couple. People complain that it's been done before (Romeo and Juliet) and that it's boring. They only enjoy the second half which consists of everyone dying. I'm here to say that is an unfair call.THE GOODThere's nothing wrong with an unoriginal story, as long as the execution is good. After all, we're running out of original stories. Even Shakespeare had a tendency to take other people's stories. He just told them really well. So, is Titanic well executed? yes, on the most part. While it does have it's flaws, I think the bulk of the film is amazing. It's well paced, the characters are well-developed, the cinematography is awe-inspiring, and the conflict is one that continues to exist today (people being forced into loveless relationships due to different pressures). Like Romeo and Juliet, this film is a classic.THE BADThis is a nitpick. Cameron decided to make the film as if an older Rose is telling a captain the story via flashback. That's fine and it works well the entire film. But the ending is just rushed and not much of a lesson like ti should have been. The Captain of the submarine crew should have disposed of the Heart of the Ocean, not Rose. That way it would show Rose's lesson got through to someone. Why even introduce the Captain and a conflict if they're just going to be forgotten at the end of the film.Once again, a nitpick, but the movie is three hours. Why is the ending so rushed? I just wished they could have gave the future part of the film a more satisfying ending.VERDICTGreat film, 9/10, see it! Whether you'll like it or hate it, this is one of the four essentials of the 90's, along with Pulp Fiction, Terminator 2, and Forrest Gump.",9
283,"There is nothing to say about this movie, I think it's a really good movie. I've watched the movie 17 times and I still don't get bored watching the movie......Excellent actors, excellent script, excellent music and excellent Titanic.... A movie that deserves the Oscars it received until the very end... IMdB score is low I think .Everyone should watch this movie...",8
284,"For those who were of serious movie-watching age in 1997, ""Titanic"" was more than just a movie...it was a cultural milestone. In an era before the Internet was as omnipresent as it is today, ""Titanic"" still managed to transcend its celluloid and become part of pop culture lore. It easily vaulted to the top of the all-time charts (though has now been passed by ""Avatar"" and ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""). However, along the way ""Titanic"" gained a bit of a reputation as a ""chick flick"", what with ""dreamy Leo"" and the somewhat schmaltzy romance between him and Kate Winslet's character. Fortunately, what I've learned after a recent re-watch of the film is that it still manages to hold up as an epic for all-comers (at least for the most part) despite its branding as sappy.For a basic plot summary, ""Titanic"" tells the story of Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), both passengers on the maiden (and obviously final) voyage of the R.M.S. Titanic. Rose is a member of the ""upper crust"" first class, pledged to be wed to the stodgy, controlling Cal (Billy Zane). Jack is a free-wheeling vagabond who wins his ticket in a poker game just minutes before the ship departs. On the first night of the voyage, Rose has a breakdown and is about to jump from the bow of the ship...until she is stopped by the charming Jack. A Romeo and Juliet-esque romance begins, coming to a head when the great boat strikes an iceberg and beings taking on water.The main reason I can appreciate ""Titanic"" is because I like films that really ""go for it"", so to speak. ""Titanic"" is meant to be an epic, and director/creator James Cameron pulls out all the stops to make that happen. The visually sequences are stunning (the CGI is a bit visible by today's standards, but not terrible), the scope of the project is momentous, and the romance is just as over-the-top to match. Had a lesser film tried to get away with some of the Jack-and- Rose cheesiness pulled here, it would have been a disaster. But for some reason, it just works in ""Titanic"" (again, I think because of the epic nature of the whole project).Cameron also could not have picked a better setting for an epic. We are now over 100 years removed from the fateful sinking, yet it is an event that still carries a high level of fascination...the ""unsinkable ship"" sinks to the bottom of the Atlantic. I think Cameron also makes a great decision to go the high-drama route, as this easily could have been turned into an ultra-realistic pseudo-documentary of the event. I'm sure that (knowing Cameron's style) much research was done to make things as accurate as possible, but the fictional presence of Jack and Rose adds that layer of high drama that turns the whole production into a prestige event.The only reason I can't give ""Titanic"" the full five stars? Well, there's two, actually: First, Cameron really lays the ""class differences"" stuff on thick in the latter stages of the film. It is set up perfectly in the beginning, but as the film drew to a close I wanted to be enthralled by the sinking visuals or swept away in the sheer emotion, not be constantly beaten over the head with the ""first class are conniving snobs while third class are the unsung heroes"" trope. I know from ""Avatar"" that Cameron has little qualms about obviously sticking his own beliefs into films (and doing so quite heavily), so maybe that's just par for the course for his films. Secondly, I honestly believe that better casting could potentially have been done with the Rose character. In no way do I wish to demean the talents of Kate Winslet, as I know she is a wonderful actress in her own right, but I never felt like she was right for this part. She is great as the uptight Rose, but I never really bought into her as the ""moon-eyed lover"" of Jack. It felt odd to me. Luckily, DiCaprio is a joy to behold on screen in the film, so some of the chemistry issues are solved by his sheer enthusiasm.I think that ""Titanic"" is one of those movies that got so big, so fast, that now its reputation proceeds it a bit. I found a similar thing happened to the film ""Dead Poet's Society"". Whereas now standing up on a desk to make a point is ""old hat"", there was a time when it was truly riveting. That same logic must apply to ""Titanic"", too. Whether you are watching it for the first time or re-watching it for the umpteenth time, this is a flick where the slightest bit of cynicism can ruin the entire experience. You have to clear the slate of the mind every single time and enjoy the epic experience for what it is. If you can do that, ""Titanic"" is truly a treasure.",8
285,"Disaster movies might be my favorite genre. There's a simple formula to these movies: the first half hour is the set-up and then the roof caves in. Writer/director/producer James Cameron missed the memo. Cameron takes over an hour and a half to get to the meat and potatoes. It's time wasted. The first half of ""Titanic"" is long and tedious. The bookend story isn't that interesting. The voyage stuff is pure melodrama. The dialogue is corny with way too much ""explaining"". That stuff is informative but it never sounds real. For some reason the strong cast isn't very good either. Overall, they get a grade of C+. It's when ""Titanic"" hits the iceberg that the movie really comes alive. It's exciting and very emotional. The last hour or so is classic. I saw ""Titanic"" twice in the theater. Once when it first came out and the other time was for its 3D re-release. I've also seen it a bunch of times at home (including tonight). I don't watch it as often as I did because I'm starting to really dislike the first half. Dishonorable mention: Kate Winslet's less than thrilling nude scene.",7
286,"When I say that, I am not kidding anyone. Had I knew it earlier, I will have posted my review here beforehand. I had watched it once when it was at the cinemas here (and someone I know actually watched more than once!), watched twice or something when it was on the television here. The last time was like few years back on the television.It goes to show how much I so love the movie, despite some may think now it's cheesy to bring it up. Hey, this was a box office winner and it's still at the top here in terms of ticket earnings for an opening release of a movie, from what I know. And whenever I heard Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On', I will almost become a drama mama. Literally.Interstingly, I first remembered back then some years back in my school days, I was doing a comprehension passage about the cruise liner prior to the movie's release and the thing at that time, I had never thought much about the comprehension passage I did after that. I had never thought that it will become a big blockbuster of the time few years later it came out. Till I (even) begged my family that I wanted to go watch it at the cinema (which it happened). I know it's all fiction in the movie about the love story of Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCapirio) before watching it.The entire movie setting is almost perfect and it will almost bring you back of the era when the actual cruise liner had its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York. Even as I was watching each time, I had often wished I am boarding a luxury cruise liner (still waiting for that day). Anyone can dream.I have to kind of admit, interestingly, I never cried (but just felt deeply moved then) towards the end of the movie when I first saw it but subsequently when it was on the television here, tears almost started to come out of my eyes.Almost a real perfect masterpiece. Just don't care what others will say.",9
287,"Warning: may be some small spoilers.I have always been a James Cameron fan. He is really one of the only directors I can say that has never made a bad film. Even his Piranha 2 was humorous and a fine effort coming from such a young director with a small budget. He has made, from what I can recall, two masterpieces (Aliens and Terminator 2) a genre pioneer (Terminator) and one of the best action movies to come out in the 90's ( True Lies ) and an ambitious touching film ( The Abyss ). But now he has outdone himself with Titanic. I don't think there has ever been a film that has taken me through such a wide array of emotions as this one. And that is all attributed to Cameron. He wrote, produced and directed this film. And it is one of the best films ever made.We all know the story of Titanic. A great ship sets sail for the U.S. from the U.K. and along the way it sinks and many people lost their lives in the Atlantic somewhere near Newfoundland. So there is no need to retell those events documentary style. A Night To Remember is there for that purpose. So what Cameron's Titanic does is tells the tale of fictitious characters blended in with real ones amidst the real events of the sinking. And it not only makes the film entertaining, it shows the sheer horror of what happened that night and makes you more sympathetic to the characters because you spend three hours with them. This is a brilliant, brilliant film.To start with, the actors are perfect. Not just DiCaprio and Winslet, but everyone from Zane and Bates right down to Paxton as the present day treasure hunter. But it is Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio that are the true stars here as it the two of them that have to carry the load and make us care about them. And we do. We can feel them falling in love. We can feel the helpless emotions that Jack feels when he is trying to tell Rose that he loves her the day of the sinking. It is their relationship that is a great strength of the film.Next, what has to be mentioned is the score by James Horner. Very few times has a motion picture had a score that symbolized the sheer hopelessness and tragedy that is on screen. But here Horner has a perfect and somber piece of music that will bring tears to your eyes, especially when lives and love are lost.Also, the whole scope of the film is one of tragedy. It is a tragic love story, a tragic story of refugees trying to make a better life for themselves and have it all end abruptly with a giant piece of ice. It is a sad look at bureaucracy and wealth and how it can manipulate and control many things.But most importantly, this is a love story and an inspirational tearjerker. Rose and Jack fall fast and hard and it doesn't matter that they are from different worlds. Love sees no boundaries. If it is there, nothing can stop it. Not even death.Titanic is perfect in every sense. And as a guy, it is my duty not to cry in movies. I know how ridiculously old fashioned that sounds but it is true. We just aren't supposed to. But I left my testosterone at the door and when I finally let go, I found myself brought to tears as the scenes of children clinging for life in the frigid waters would be enough to bring the strongest man to tears. Cameron has manipulated us to perfection here and even if you find the romance to be embellished (which I don't) to watch this film and know that this happened, is a sad and disturbing reality. Few films have ever done this to me. Few have ever made me feel such a connection to the characters. Titanic does, and by the end of the film, you feel like you know the people of Titanic like they were your long lost relatives. And one final note: I can't understand how anyone could not enjoy the film, that's just me. But I know that what moves some does nothing for others. But the backlash towards this film is not necessary. Not every film has to be Ramboesque. Not every film has to be filled with explosions. I am not opposed to those films, I actually love many of them, but I am also prone to well written stories, whether they are love stories or not. Those who criticize this film need to realize that there is a market for this. The gross for this film and the demographics it appealed to confirm that.As for the comment made earlier about those of us that enjoyed it being teens and have never seen a film before 1990, well I am 27, my brother is 24, my mom is 50 something and my grandmother is in her 80's. And we all loved it. So keep that in mind. And a film does not gross 2 BILLION dollars by having only teens see it.This is as good as a film gets!One final note. The SE DVD finally came out and it was worth the wait. The transfer is beautiful and if you are like me and love DVD's so you can access the special features, then this disc is for you. The commentary alone by Cameron makes the disc worth spending your money on. Cameron doesn't do a lot of commentaries, but the ones he does are perhaps the most insightful commentaries out there. Titanic, he outdoes himself. I really recommend everyone who loves this film to get the SE DVD and just sti back for 3 hours and listen to what he has to say.",10
288,"Big, grand, epic romance is a fictional but vivid and lavish telling of the maiden voyage of the doomed luxury liner. The story spotlights a youthful, star-crossed romance between a blue-collar American wanderer/artist (DiCaprio), and a pampered but open-hearted rich girl (Winslet) yearning to experience life. A long but truly breathtaking retelling of the grandest ship of its time is aided immeasurably by Cameron's stellar direction and marvelous set design, made all the more believable by a superb cast and a finale that's nothing short of remarkable. If you're going to remake history, this is certainly a way to do it. A large-scale epic that actually delivers, one that will be remembered for years to come. ***½",
289,"I know there are some out there who snicker at this movie when it is mentioned, yet if so many people hated it, why is it the biggest selling movie of all time in America. It sold more than Star Wars, and George Lucas released that movie more than once. I found this shocking, but it happened. Ticket sales don't lie, and for those who laugh at this movie now, they are probably some of the same ones that saw it in the theater. Hypocrites.My own experience with Titanic was a good one and yes I am a guy. I enjoyed the back story that followed before the sinking, and this is probably Cameron's best film to date. Yes it's even better than the first two Terminator films and Aliens, and they are all movies that I appreciated.Many didn't like this film because of Leonardo DiCaprio. Yes he's given better acting performances in other movies (What's Eating Gilbert Grape), but in Titantic he was still very good. Of course I don't think people dislike DiCaprio because of his acting. They just don't like him for some reason. Yet I never heard anything bad about him before Titanic made him a mega superstar.In my opinion, Titanic is a great film. It was one of the best in 1997 and was still popular in the summer of 1998 when it was still being shown in the theaters. That alone is a fantastic achievement. So all you hypocrites can laugh all you want. The fact is that this movie is still well liked by many, and is still the biggest selling movie of all time in 2006. Update, very late I know. Avatar surpassed this movie in sales directed by who else, James Cameron again. Incredible.",10
290,I watched this movie and I fell inlove with Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Jane Winslet) with their outstanding act. It's the most heartbreaking movie I have ever watched my entire life and until now I can't move on.It's like watching a love story and turns into tragedy. Imagine that? How hurtful it is if you were at the Titanic and seeing your love dies. It is so painful but still worth to watch especially if you like sad endings. This is what you've been looking for!!!,10
291,"When I was watching I liked it a little but afterwards the more I thought about the more I disliked it. The thing that made me more mad was that it somehow managed to steal Oscars from L.A. Confidential,Good Will Hunting ,Full Monty,and As Good As It Gets.I have seen all of them and any one of them should of won. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are probably the worst people in the world both of them are stuck up and ugly. James Cameron is a great director but this time he has sunk as low as the Titanic.",1
292,"Titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship. Writer/Director James Cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the Titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the North Atlantic. The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make for a good on-screen couple. DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable. They both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well. The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film. The love story, the action, suspense, and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time. The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation. The pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg. Overall Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially DiCaprio and Winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch.",8
293,"I did not like Titanic. I thought the acting was way way way over the top, it definitely was not historically accurate, and the whole old-woman-with-the-valuable-necklace thing was just way too over the top. I am a fan of Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet (I think she's maybe the best actress working today in films) but I couldn't stand this movie. The fact that is was so very over-hyped to me by my girlfriend at the time who saw it with her friends before dragging me to go see it did not help probably. The action was pretty good with great effects of the boat sailing the ocean and especially during the sinking scenes, but it felt very long and was trying way too hard to pluck at heartstrings. I don't understand why the leads had to have the fate that they did, don't want to spoil it but if you've seen it I think you know what I mean when I say why couldn't she share the furniture? Overacting, overly desperate to cause us to have an emotional reaction, I think it will go down as a well produced movie that was too basic a story, an unoriginal love story, and way over-hyped because for some reason a lot of people loved it when it came out.",
294,"Titanic was a pop culture phenomenon upon its release, breaking box-office and awards records. It obviously struck a chord.Titanic was an old-fashioned romance that happened to be made by a man who used revolutionary techniques. The first half of the film was about two star-crossed lovers from different strata and the second was about the disaster. The setting was used to look at the different attitudes about class and wealth as well as tell an emotional human story. Whilst scenes of the disaster supply lots of peril and excitement.Even though Titanic was a smash hit I doubt it made today because it was over three hours long and not based on a recognisable property. Studios want franchises and avoid making films over two and half hours.",8
295,"A tragic story. And not in the sense that it made me cry. This film is pathetic. The love story is tedious, the depiction of Irish peasantry panders to the crassest stereotypes and Celine Dion's stinky theme song is just the icing an a horrible anti-cake. Somewhere along the line, around about Terminator 2 and True Lies, director James Cameron went badly astray. He became so obsessed with setting new Special Effects standards that he lost sight of characters, dramatic plausibility and any measure of emotional honesty, which are all far more essential to a film's credibility. The characters in this film are bland and uninspiring. To call them one-dimensional would be an insult to Geometry.It's ironic that a film which cost so much to make in terms of special effects should go for the cheapest possible emotional return - Billy Zane is his usual camp, pantomime-villain self, Leonardo DiCaprio is as wet as the sea he eventually (thankfully) drowns in and even the usually reliable David Warner is flat and listless. This film gets three out of ten. And all those points are for the last hour when the ship sinks - the only good part of the film. The rest of it should be consigned to the bottom of the Atlantic and left there to rot.",3
296,"(THIS *&%$#! COMMENT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.)(Or it may not.At least it may spoil your appetite for this film.)I have to give James Cameron credit for a sort of devious ingenuity: He created a movie so repulsively bad that a reasonably sophisticated viewer would find it unbearable to sit through. Hence, so many glowing reviews.I watched it, once. But it keeps popping up on TV. And even for free it is not worth watching. Five minutes these days is my absolute limit. Each time I stumble across it, this movie just seems to get worse and worse. The acting is so bad I'm surprised Cameron didn't just make this into a sort of Disney cartoon. Disney's Buena Vista does this sort of simplistic bubble gum movie better, such as White Fang; Ethan Hawke as Jack Conroy was more credible than DiCaprio as Dawson. And the aerial computer graphics look way too much like cartoon animation.As to historical accuracy, give me a break!!! I can't say this is any worse than the other nonsense to come out of Hollywood, though. Frankly, anyone who takes any so-called non-fiction or historical movies as more than 1 percent accurate is a fool.Hey, I am willing to suspend a certain amount of disbelief for a good movie, but this one demands way too much. They pull a drawing that has been sitting on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean for 80 years that is in excellent condition and hold it up as proof of why it was worth hundreds of millions of dollars to find the Titanic. And what is this precious work of art? A Rembrandt? A DaVinci? A Van Gogh, at least? No, it is an amateurish pornographic sketch. Excuse me? Maybe some 21st century girl would pose naked at the drop of a hat, but a proper girl in the 1910s?Hey, if you believe this nonsense, then the rest of the movie will seem comparatively plausible, and I can see how you might find this movie ""historically accurate."" I don't mind if you enjoyed this movie; that's what movies are for. Tastes vary. Some people prefer emotional manipulation that is more subtle. I would hope you Titanic fans would explore cinema a little more, and not insist that this is the greatest movie ever made, perfect, etc. What's with all these superlatives? Does Cameron have a claque?Look, before you say Titanic is the best movie EVER, (which implies you have seen every movie every made) at least go see Gone With the Wind. I dare you. Then see if you can even mention Titanic in the same breath.And I think potential viewers should be forewarned that not everybody is going to like this movie. That's what reviews are for. Spoiler ahead: OK, the ship was named ""Titanic"" and it sank. That much they got right. Well, sort of: it was the RMS Titanic, not the SS Titanic.If you want to learn the true story, try going to the BBC page ""Titanic: Sinking the Myths,"" by Paul Louden-Brown.",3
297,"Kate Winslet (Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind) stars as Rose, a young rich lady who travels on the Titanic, the boat which is destined to change human kind for ever as it sets sail in 1912. The story is told from an older Rose's point of view as she experiences life on the ""unsinkable ship"". Meeting Jack Dawson (Leo Di Caprio  Gangs of New York) this charming romantic tale brings out a heart-warming story of young love with an unmissable ending.Winner of 11 Oscars, David Cameron's Titanic is a wonderful tale of two young people who meet and begin to learn about life in different ways from one another. Winslet and Di Caprio are perfect as the two characters. From the wealthy and stubborn Rose to the relaxed and positive Jack, audiences can appreciate each character's different backgrounds and engage more into their lives. The characters are well developed in this film, giving the film more depth. Di Caprio and Winslet have good on screen chemistry making the film engaging and light hearted.Many critics have argued its predictability and its clichés but with a film like this, you have to look past them to the depth and control of the power of the characters and the surroundings in which they find themselves.The ending for me was really powerful and difficult to watch, I was close to tears. However it is a must watch as the film delivers twist after twist in a powerful climax.It's a very good film and one of the best love stories of all time",9
298,"So, bit of backstory for me and this movie. When I was but a wee moviegoer my birthday came around and there were two big movies playing: Titanic and Flubber. At that age? I wanted to see Flubber, hands down, no question. We saw Titanic. Ever since then, I've had something of an unfair distaste for this one but recently I thought, ""It's been years, Cameron made it... I need to give it a fair chance.""Well, I can comfortably say that while I don't think it's for me, I was unfair to this as a child. It really lives up to the Cameron pedigree of being just absolutely gorgeous. The way he made that ship feel, the size of it, the grandeur is just the kind of master craft we come to expect of the man. The cast deliver solid performances throughout, there's a proper sense of drama, even though we all know how it's going to play out.Where it loses me is in the over-the-top nature of the love story. It feels like he's going for a Shakespearean, Romeo and Juliet type of romance epic and I just can't help but feel it's over the top. Beyond that, I could really do without the whole modern aspect of the story. I just feel like it slows stuff down and doesn't really bring anything to the story.Whelp, child me was wrong. This is a pretty solid movie, stunning to look at but is a little too cloying for my tastes still. I will no longer actively avoid it, won't flip the channel if it happens to be on. Can't say I'll be seeking it out again anytime soon, but who knows.",6
299,"The cinema viewer may well wonder whether there can be any real suspense when it is clear from the beginning of the film that the central character, Rose (Kate Winslet), will survive the disaster that befalls the Titanic. But suspense there is, not least because we don't know whether her lover will make it. There is also action, social (class) comment, drama, historical notes - not least several comments on the cause of the initial impact and why it was so disastrous - and good old fashioned romance.Rarely has a three hour film seemed so short. It canters. The romance at the centre of the plot develops quickly and my attention was held not only by developments in this story but the events that, taken together, spelt disaster for the 'unsinkable' ship, and then the aftermath of the ship's collision with that famous iceberg.Kate Winslet was simply gorgeous and put in a fine performance, as did Leonardo di Caprio as Jack Dawson. The make-up of the older Rose (Gloria Stuart) was one of the less convincing aspects of the movie, but it seems churlish to draw attention to such a detail; in any case, it's to be expected that an 87 year old will need a fair amount of facial recontouring and war-paint to play a woman of 101.",8
300,"I don't get it. What was spectacular about Titanic? Sure, the special effects were nice for the time, but groundbreaking? Not in my book. The characters were... well likable. Not lovable, nor classic, but likable. The plot? Cookie-cutter. Poor boy meets rich girl, poor boy falls instantly in love with rich girl, rich girl does the same, poor boy dies (Seriously, were you not expecting someone to die. You knew the boat was going to sink). Throw in a historical tragedy, and Wam! Insta-plot. And it gets 11 Oscars. What happened? I mean, Titanic certainly wasn't a make-up Oscar for Cameron for T2.Titanic is one of those films where they intentionally stuff as many things to tug on the heartstrings as possible without actually being engaging or interesting. Pearl Harbor did the EXACT same formula, yet critics panned it.It's OK, yet not sensational in anyway.",3
301,"James Cameron's timeless tale of forbidden love and the tragic sinking of the colossal Titanic is a beloved classic in its own right. The story this movie tells always tugs at my heart each time I see it. The emphasis of the terrible fate of the Titanic is heightened by the tragic love story that backs up the short time-line of the glorious ship as it heads towards its fate. The cast is fabulous, magnificent and really breathes life into their characters to make them realistic. Leonardo DiCaprio as the care- free, young and handsome Jack Dawson is the embodiment of who we all wish to be like in life whereas Kate Winslet's Rose DeWitt Bukater embodies where we lie in life if we don't attempt to break free and try and live a new life or experience a different world. The beauty of how real the film is adds to the majesty of the film's grandeur to the details of the ship the crew built and the characters that died or survived the disaster inhabit the structure. Anyone who loves an epic should check out this fantastic tale of love, tragedy and survival.",8
302,"All right, we get the picture about the great special effects, etc. The *grand scale* everything was done in. I still, after all of my time on this earth, find it hard to believe that people can be brainwashed SO much by media hype.I'm not about to say the movie was *bad*. I would probably use the word *contrived*. This movie contains just about everything that a rational human being should be repulsed by:-> a cheesy soundtrack that lingers *to this day* on radio stations everywhere.-> a mass of Titanic zombies who keep talking and talking and talking about the movie.-> an embellished and trite ""historical"" plot based on ""real"" events.There is absolutely no way that this movie should have taken up 3 hours of your time, save the fact that it was so expensive they probably didn't want to waste one inch of film.  I guess they figured since you already know the ending, they'd string you along with overdone, poorboy-richgirl cliches and special effects.  Yeah, the effects *were* great (I certainly couldn't do them); I'm just praying for the day when it's finlly passe to even talk about special effects.Consider that DreamWorks, the company stemming from the little project know as the Star Wars Trilogy, had to invent special effects, invent the tools to invent the special effects, and had virtually no prior model to base any of their work (or at least techniques) on.  Today it's all old hat; who can write programs that render graphics quickly; who is the resident software expert; who can do the most in the least amount of time. I guess once we get sick of 100% computer-graphic-generated movies, we'll stop all this nonsense already.",
303,"I must say I'm surprised at the low IMDb rating of 7.3 and that there are a lot of negative reviews on this website. But compared with millions loving this and winner of 11 academy awards, those voices of discontent against this film are left in the shade. Arguably for me James Cameron's greatest film. Titanic is a true epic of colossal scale. The acting is brilliant particularly with Leonardo Decaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose. They light up the screen as the two lovers separated by social class but not love. There romance is so beautifully depicted that you can't help but smile. The romantic story set aside the sinking is flawlessly intertwined.Though the film is in two parts the romance and the sinking the first hour and a half gives you the chance to come to know these two characters and others like nasty Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) and LoveJoy (David Warner) who play there parts excellently well with great support from Kathy Bates who plays the lively Molly Brown. There are some beautiful and forever memorable scenes between Jack and Rose when Jack first sees her, the third class party, when they kiss on the bow of the ship, Jack painting her naked, when they make love in the car and when they are both in the water after the ship has sunk and Jack dies. All these scenes and others are amazing. The music score by James Horner is hauntingly beautiful and sombre and made me cry when you see the full sinking in all it's horror.And you do James Cameron depicts everything showing not just the sinking from Jack and Roses perspective but different people in different parts of the ship as they scream desperately for help. So you end up caring not just for the main characters but all the small cameo roles played by hundreds of people. Morality questions are raised about how things were handled by white star liner. These are haunting images that burn in your mind and stay with you long after. The most haunting scene is when loads of passengers are in the water and when most of them had died. The cameras focusing on one of the lifeboats coming back is the ethereal feel of a mythic force. Cameron creates suspense and tension at whether the two lovers will survive and you just deeply care about them. The costumes and ship itself look simply magnificent and are a wonder to look at. The end scene as well where the old Rose dies in her sleep and has the happy memory of marrying Jack on Titanic and when he dies in the water made me cry my eyes out and is one of the best scenes I have ever seen in film. Titanic is a epic film and James Cameron has shown this disaster in all it's horror and is a tribute to the victims of this tragedy. In 2012 there has been a rumour that he is going to re-release the film in 3D. It will be even more incredible no doubt (he proved that with Avatar) but it's the storytelling,which will recapture the myth of this fascinating tale that has been told throughout world generations. Even now as one reviewer Baybee from Austrailia quotes about Titanic the film.""This would have to be one of the most wonderful films of the 20th century and one that will never be forgotten""I couldn't have put it better myself. Even after watching this time after time the film still has that powerful impact of making me feel sad. Truly remarkable.",10
304,"The producers and writers of Titanic obviously believed they'd bore and alienate the targeted teen and twenty-something audience to the point of losing them if the characters had the attitudes, mannerisms and style of speech that was appropriate for the time, so they had Jack (Leonardo Dicaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslett) speaking contemporary dialogue in a contemporary style, or at least contemporary for '97. A young man in 1912 would not say, ""You seem more like an indoor girl."" Aside from a certain hostile type of mental patient or the most outrageous and anti-social bohemian agitator, young adults in 1912 did not repeatedly tell their elders to shut up. The creators of the film are counting on what they perceive to be the teen and young adult's lack of knowledge or interest in the values and social customs of the very early 20th century. Since they want the audience to get swept away by the drama and romance of Jack and Rose they want them to relate to everything about them. I remember that this was billed as somewhat of a a fantasy re-imagining of a real event, but this type of historical revisionism, I think, in which human behavior is simply made more familiar, is an insult to any viewer with a 3-digit I.Q. One continuity problem that really gets me is how, when the ship is sinking and Jack and Rose are still inside, the water level is lower and the water becomes calmer around them every time they have a conversation. Again, the makers of the film don't want the reality of the disaster to encroach on, or distract us from, the passionate young romance they're trying to draw us into. Clearly the creators of the film think that the romance is a bigger draw for a major segment of the audience than the story of an enormous disaster that killed over 1,500 people and I'm sure they're right, but often when true and fictional stories exist in the same movie, one weakens the impact of the other, and it's certainly true in this case. I haven't seen the new 3D version but I assume the only change is the 3D effect. This is a bland, pandering, intelligence-insulting and epically overrated epic.",1
305,"Titanic, newly released from Paramount Pictures on Blu-ray3D and digital, didn't completely sweep the Academy Awards in 1998 – it only took 11 of the Oscar statuettes! Among them: Best Picture, a Best Director for James Cameron and a Best Cinematography for Russell Carpenter. Some of that sweeping cinematography is bound to be lost on a home screen, but home surround-sound can do a nice job on its Oscar- winning Best Sound. Seasoned KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Raven Devanney, age 15, calls Titanic a ""romantic masterpiece."" The film evokes strong emotion partly because of the real-life tragedy it recreates but also thanks to the intimate love story Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet bring to life. That the film is 15 years old does not diminish its impact. Says Raven, "" even though I've seen it about a billion times, I still get choked up."" On a scale of one to five, she rates it a five only because higher numbers aren't available. TitanicReviewed by Raven Devanney See her full review on video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huGlaj1F_d0 Titanic is my favorite movie by far. This romantic masterpiece starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet tells a tale of love, loss and tragedy. I remember the first time I watched Titanic. I was 7 years old, and I've been hooked ever since. This was the first film that really made me cry, and even though I've seen it about a billion times, I still get choked up. This movie is beautifully done. I love that the cinematography is so grand and breathtaking even though the film came out in 1997. I especially love the way they capture the Titanic in all its glory. I'm a total history geek when it comes to the Titanic. I've seen every documentary and read every book there is to read about the Titanic, so the fact that they used actual footage of the wreckage of Titanic was really cool. My favorite characters are Rose and Jack, of course! They defy the rules of their different social statuses and are in true love. Not only are those characters great, but Kate and Leonardo do a masterful job in these roles. I love the whole movie, but my favorite scene would have to be when Rose and Jack are running through the ship away from the butler after the drawing scene. It lightens the mood of the film before the sinking and is quite funny. Plus, you almost get a mini tour of the ship. I also admire the final few scenes in which the ship is sinking. The way it is captured is amazing. It's the perfect mix of chaos and emotion, which really conveys the tragedy in a brilliant way. Like I said, this film is very tragic, and that fact that it was an actual event makes it even more sad. I would recommend this film for all ages, even though it is sad and slightly inappropriate. I watched it when I was 7 and nothing bothered me. This is a must-see movie, and I give it five out of five stars. I'd give it more if I could! Titanic is in stores now on DVD and Blu-ray, so be sure to add it to your home movie collection today!",10
306,"This movie should have never have been nominated for any Oscars. It is mindless drivel! I wanted to throw things at the screen(but I didn't because it's not the screen's fault that the movie sucked). I will never understand why so many people liked this movie. I saw this movie in the theatre expecting a cinematic triumph, instead, the only emotion it evoked in me was pain because after seeing all that water I really had to pee. It was also painful because the amount of sap in that movie could fill the Hoover Dam.If I had known how repulsive this movie was before I spent $7 to see it, I would've avoided it altogether.",1
307,"Breathtaking it was not. Amazing? I don't think so. Brilliant? Yeah right! The best movie ever made? Not even close. Yet, the Box Office would make out that this pathetic attempt to reinact a tragic undertaking (which has been reinacted more times than I care to count) was actually pretty good. Very good, even. Hell - because of the soppy do-gooders of the world that went to see this, it's the Highest Grossing movie of all time, and we're told that it's a 'wonderful tale, with wonderful actors, a wonderful script and wonderful sets'.PULEEEEEESE! There is absolutely no talent in Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet or Billy Zane, the sets were completely overdone, and unrealistically fake, the script was complete Loserville-ish and boring.The only part that was good was when Rose was going to fall off the ship, and when that guy gets hit by the ship propeller at the end. This undeserved multiple Oscar Award winning film rates 1½/10 - James Cameron should not have wasted his time and money!!",
308,"I'm not a person who is greatly interested in romance stories.  I tend to go for action-packed flicks, horror stories, mysteries, or good suspense thrillers.  Comedies are also favorites.  Titanic, however, shed new light on romance stories.  The people in Titanic were portrayed so realistically, unlike other movies.  In Titanic, you could actually feel what was going on inside the people's minds and hearts.  The special effects were among the best I've seen.  I've only seen it four times to date, and it's definitely worth another four.",10
309,"If you have not seen Titanic, I'm sure you've heard of it, and of so, please do watch it because not only is the film a ""great watch"" or a great ""thrill ride of suspense and emotional scenes"", but Titanic is one of the greatest films of all time. The film has some of the best acting from Winslet and DiCaprio and some of the best character chemistry between them. The direction lead by James Cameron is phenomenal. The ending to the film is one of the most intense, beautiful and sad endings I've ever seen, i can not remark one flaw about it. The cinematography is great and the film has some of the best and most memorable shots in cinema history (yes, that including the scene where Jack holds Rose up at the ship deck). The soundtrack is amazing, including Celine Dion's fantastic song that totally fits the feel of the film. Titanic is a must watch, one i would have killed for to see on the big screen! I will be posting a review of AHS Apocalypse Episode 3 this evening after the confirmed return of Cordelia, Madison and Myrtle, so exciting!! Stay tuned",10
310,"""there are only lifeboats for half the people... yea the better half"".The segregation, oppression, and unenlightened separation of the privileged few from the unkempt, unwashed masses is the ""dramatic"" thread that seems to be the ""soul"" of this bloated, overwritten, orally deficient melodrama. It is completely counterpointed by the very last scene. An antithesis of the socially conscious concern of the film makers.It is morally reprehensible, irresponsible, incomprehensible, and downright selfish. One wonders how many underprivileged children with empty bellies and deplorable living conditions could have been saved by that mega-million dollar necklace. All for a cheap sentimental tug.Some interesting special effects, attractive people, and unintentional humor are not enough to redeem this unforgivable, utter failure of a film that can only be subjugated to the lower decks of American Cinema.",1
311,"I know in advance this review is not going to be popular; but it is my honest opinion for what it's worth. This is not a review of the 3-D version.The final hour of this movie is incredibly captivating; the effects are astonishing, the human drama endlessly gripping and the horror of the terrible tragedy deeply moving and powerful. Direction by James Cameron is impeccable, he thoroughly deserved his Oscar; the film looks wonderful and the music score is marvellous.But is it really such a classic? I think not, personally. A Night To Remember may have dated effects-wise but it tells the story of The Titanic in a superior way to this movie. The big problem for me is the script; which for the most part I think is quite poor. Cameron lifts whole segments from A Night To Remember, inserts dialogue from the testimonies given during the enquiry into the cause of the disaster, and alters history in a way that must have been quite shocking to the descendants of those involved. Officer Murdoch, for instance. He did not shoot two passengers; nor is it very likely he committed suicide. Murdoch's decision to reverse the engines when the iceberg was spotted probably caused the disaster - Titantic would have missed it had the full ahead order been given; even a nose-on impact would not have sunk the ship. But there is no evidence whatsoever Murdoch, who distinguished himself in the aftermath of the accident, committed suicide. Just a few passenger rumours that one of the officers shot himself.Kate and Leo. Nice acting from Kate, DiCaprio is simply too young for the man of the world artist. He has matured into a very fine actor, but the ""romance"" never convinces me for an instant. Far too much time is spent on it; with the result that the story of the Titanic is sort of shoe-horned into the movie in a series of brief sequences. The whole question of The Californian is omitted to give Kate and Leo more screen time, and The Carpathia barely appears. Lightoller's remarkable escape is hardly referenced: and here the brave but slightly misguided officer comes across as panicky and arrogant. Very unfair indeed.The result is rather fake emotionalism and moonshine, rather like Avatar, in fact, although admittedly Titanic is a better movie.Some of the acting in this movie is also very poor. Billy Zane is quite awful as Cal. He gives a performance that would do Dick Dastardly proud. All he really needed was a few moustache twirls and evil titters. One-dimensional character; one dimensional acting. Excellent actors like Kathy Bates, Bernard Hill and David Warner are wasted in this movie.The film has much to commend it but my honest assessment is that it also has a lot of flaws. Time for you to mark me down! :)",7
312,"Some time ago I watched ""A night to remember"" (1958, Roy Ward Baker), a film about the Titanic. This film was the direct cause to rewatch the ""ultimate"" Titanic movie of James Cameron.Both films tell of course the same story and share a number of comparable scenes (there is a you tube item where this comparison is acually made) and nonetheless the atmposhere is remarkably different. This difference is of course attributable to the romance between Rose (first class passenger played by Kate Winslet) and Jack (third class passenger played by Leonardo DiCaprio).Through this romance Cameron is able to sketch class distinctions well before the scenes in which third class passangers are denied access to the lifeboats. The distinction is most visible in the scenes in which Jack fist dines with Rose in the first class and Rose thereafter visits the dance evening in the third class.Cameron not only shows the distinction he also makes a value judgement. The first class passengers are (in majority) bad and hypocrite, the third class is on the contrary good, honest and full of life. This value judgement maybe somewhat generalising (for example the first class passenger Molly Brown (an excellent role of Kathy Bates) is rather sympathetic) but fits into the view in which the disaster with the Titanic is not just a ""traffic accident"" but symbolizes the decline of the 19th century class society and the end of the optimism at the start of the 20th century. In this symbolic view the iceberg stands for World War I.In some ways the romance between Jack and Rose is overdone. Especially Jack is too much a prince on too white a horse. In the aformentioned dinner scene he adapts remarkably well to the first class manners, while in the rest of the film Cameron stresses the unbridgeable gap between the classes. Apart from this Jack is also a capable artist, a sharp psychologist (he foresees what will happen if Rose stays with her rich but possessive fiancé) and last but not least he knows exactly how the Titanic will collapse.Not only Jack but also the spectator knows exactly how the Titanic will collapse. Earlier in the film it was explained to the old Rose (Gloria Stuart) by a member of an expedition to the wreck of the Titanic. The romance between Jack and Rose resulted in a nude portrait of Rose and the discovery of this nude portait in a safe on the Titanic enabled Cameron to frame the story as an intelligent flashback (old Rose telling her story to the members of the crew of the expedition).On second glance I realised how smart Cameron constructed his film. The romance between Jack and Rose as a vehicle to illustrate the class society. The explanation to old Rose about the collapse of the Titanic to also inform the spectator so that he can concentrate on the human drama in scenes to come. The use of the blue Danuba from Strauss (reminding of ""2001: A space odyssey"" (1968, Stanley Kubrick)) in the scene where the first class passengers elegantly walk towards their dining table. Only the computer animations of the overwiew shots of the Titanic slightly disappointed me. They were scarcely better than the 1953 overviews (or is that a compliment to ""A night to remember""? ).""Titanic"" has grown almost synonymous with Kate Winslet and Leonardi DiCaperio. Don't forget however the supporting actresses. Kathy Bates is superb as Molly, a nouveau riche who mercilessly exposes the hypocrisy of her fellow first class passengers. Gloria Stuart, who was 86 at that time and whose performances date back to ""The old dark house"" (1932, James Whale) is a perfect old Rose.",8
313,"Why Titanic isn't on the Top 250, I just don't know. It is, by far, the most successful film of all time, and deservedly so. Nobody could have captured with such emotion and scope the depiction of what happened in the Atlantic 95 years ago except James Cameron. Terminator 3 and this had the same budget - Terminator 3 was good, but this film blew me away. It truly raises the bar for film-making and success in the film industry. It has been a couple of years since I last saw this film, and my memory starts to fail me. But you just can't forget some of the special effects on this film and how they changed the world of films. Monumental images that stick in your mind forever are created with grand scale to breathtaking effect, and the film stays emotional throughout its three hours - so you always care. This film was made to win Oscars, and win Oscars it did. Though Lord of the Rings: Return of the King managed to win all of its nominations (Titanic did have 14 nominations and won 11), box office grosses and general audience feelings will always precede Titanic as the better film. Truly a Titanic achievement... 10/10",10
314,"It's not too hard to figure out what kept audiences flocking to ""Titanic"" when it came out. The sheer spectacle of it as well as the sweeping sense of romance which Cameron succeeds in evoking made this a 'must-see' theatrical experience. At the time and even for a while after, ""Titanic"" seemed like it would go down as an epic for the ages, a masterpiece with the overwhelming reputation of classic epics like ""Gone With the Wind"". The Oscar wins seemed to cement that.Then came the backlash, which was inevitable for any film with this sort of popularity. The thing is, ""Titanic"", to some extent, deserved its backlash. It is obviously nowhere near as bad as some say, but viewed today, 12 years later, in a home setting away from the 'theatrical experience' many enjoyed back then, the movie's flaws are easily exposed. The screenplay is really not strong at all, the characters are more like caricatures, and the romance not particularly convincing. At most, during the excruciatingly long hour and some spent on set-up, this romance which Cameron seems to think is the epitome of romantic cinema, a love affair to match the scope of the film, seems like a cute fling. Jim Cameron's knack for writing some truly execrable dialogue is not gone just yet, and while I can knock back a beer or two (or seven) and watch Ripley lay waste to xenomorph after xenomorph in ""Aliens"" while cracking one-liners, it's a little hard to take in this setting. Still, most of the dialogue is solid or average, and there are some good lines. The narrative structure and momentum is nothing special at all- poor dude meets rich girl, they 'fall in love', Titanic hits the iceberg and then there's an hour of running here and there and special effects. So the film was over-hyped, yes. Jim Cameron's previous films were all better, bar ""True Lies"" and his cheap debut feature ""Piranha 2"", but that doesn't mean ""Titanic"" doesn't have its positive points. It is obviously a wonderful technical achievement that still stands tall, is very nicely-shot, and there are a number of excellent scenes. Indeed, the sheer spectacle of the final hour and some, from the moment the ship hits that iceberg, is still easy to get carried away by, and Cameron proves that he is more than capable as a popcorn entertainer. DiCaprio is very charming and proves himself as a dramatic actor in the latter stages while Winslet does her typically annoying nonsense, but on the negative side Horner's score is pretty mediocre. It's a good enough film, over-hyped yes but that is the fault of the public, not the film, which remains flawed but ultimately fairly enjoyable, on par or better than most big budget flicks and disaster movies, but it's no masterpiece, and now excuse me, I'm going to watch ""Aliens"" again.",
315,"This is, without question, one of the most overblown movies of the last twenty years. This is a romantic retelling of the infamous sinking and who do we have as stars? Two pretty people (Leo and Kate) who will never be compared to Clark and Vivian but nobody's perfect.This is a real hit and miss film. The cons are just huge: the framing story is completely unnecessary, the story is so stilted, and the whole set-up prior to the climax is just boring. Not really helping matters is that the love story seems recycled from a Lifetime TV movie.The pros are minor but save it from complete disaster. The ship sinking climax is very well done and loaded with tension, some of the cast members do very well (a good example being Victor Garber as the kindly Thomas Andrews) but I think special mention should go to David Warner as the cruel valet, Spicer Lovejoy. Warner steals every scene he's in and his death scene at the ship splitting is simply priceless.Although it doesn't hold up particularly well and is certainly no masterpiece, it's OK overall.",3
316,"This film is one of only a select few that has had the privilege of winning 11 Academy Awards, and with good reason. It is clearly one of the best films of all time. I got the privilege of seeing it earlier this year in 3D. I had already seen it before, but my parents said that it was quite the experience seeing it in theatres. They could not be more correct on that.The story is that Rose, an upper-class citizen, is engaged to a wealthy man named Cal. However, she feels trapped in her world, and she is almost pushed over the ledge when she meets Jack, a lower-class citizen. Despite their difference in social status, they take a liking to each other, despite Cal's and her mother's hatred of Jack. Despite their social status and everybody against their pairing, the two fall deeply in love, when suddenly... well, if you know the story of the RMS Titanic, then you know the rest of this story.James Cameron, you are a master filmmaker. You've done it with the Terminator movies, Aliens, True Lies, The Abyss, and you have also done it with Titanic, as well as Avatar, which is my favourite movie of all time. What Cameron is great at doing is creating a story in which the first part tells the story without all the crazy stuff happening, so that when the second part/final action scenes come, we know who to cheer for when something good happens and who to cry for when something bad happens. He did it with this movie, he did it with Avatar; it is a great way of providing the audience with amazing special effects and action sequences without them being too distracting from the movie.I must also applaud the acting. Gloria Stuart is amazing in her supporting role, and she shares much of her screen time with Bill Paxton, who also does great, despite the limitations he gets in this film. Frances Fisher is great as the overbearing mother, who seems to only care about money, and not about her daughters' wishes. Kathy Bates lightens up the screen with her witty dialogue as Molly Brown, while Billy Zane is great as the antagonist, Cal.However, it is our two leads, Leo and Kate, who truly shine here. They would later go on to act in Revolutionary Road, and both films show their chemistry well. If these two became a real-life couple, I would not be surprised, as they seem to have a whole lot of chemistry on screen.Overall, this movie is a triumph. If you have not seen it, stop reading this, turn off your computer, go to the nearest DVD store, and buy it. The dialogue might be a little cheesy for you to handle, but the actors are great, the story is great, the direction is great, etc. Overall, a 10/10 for me.",8
317,"This movie is proof that everything Loyd Kaufman said about Major Studios is right. They force their crap down our throats, remove the art from film-making, and award budgets and names instead of ingenuity and talent.This movie is bad from beginning to end. It's not just that I hate movies that are hyped, this movie is just hard to watch. I want romance, not people saying I love you over and over again. And I want a real couple, not a couple of star crossed lovers pulled out of the average crappy teen drama. And I want, maybe this is too much, to feel for the people who died on the Titanic, not cheer when the ship finally goes down.The special effects were phenomenal. But that does not make the movie great. I never liked the characters. Rich girl and poor artist. So? Why am I supposed to like them? Because they belong together even though they come from different worlds? Give me more then that. Neither of the characters was anything more then an empty shell of a being. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio tried their best but could not pump life into the characters.Many films came out that year. Many great ones. This wins the Oscar why? Do people like movies that are driven only by a tragedy that means nothing because we care nothing about the people? We have a real story. One of the most famous disasters of the 21st Century, the struggle of the people on the ship, and those trying to save them. The people who survived, those who met their demise. We don't need a love story that is completely without love.",1
318,"Titanic Um is one of the most iconic and remembered films of the 20th and 21st century. Entered pop culture, that's a hard thing to do top-notch cinematography, great acting, great plot, iconic soundtrack all praise is little for titanic.",10
319,"It's been a long time since I've watched this movie from beginning to end, so I decided to refresh my memory. I forgot how great and sad this film is. It has great characters that we come to love, and a powerful forbidden love storyline. In 1996, Brock Lovett and his team explore the Titanic wreckage in search for a necklace called the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they find a nude drawing of a woman named Rose, who was wearing the necklace the night Titanic sank. Rose is now an elderly lady, and tells Brock and his team her story aboard the Titanic.In 1912, teen-aged Rose is a first-class passenger, and going to England with her fiancé Cal. Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson wins a ticket aboard the Titanic. When Rose wants to commit suicide, Jack talks her out of it, and they soon start a relationship, defying Cal and her mom. Soon, Titanic hits the iceberg and slowly begins to sink. Every passing minute, Jack and Rose try to find a way off the doomed ship together or not at all. If you're a history buff and want a smart love story, you'll love TITANIC!!!",10
320,"When this film first came out, I was a Titanic buff and read as many books and saw as many documentaries on the actual ship as I could get my hands on. As I result, I realized the great lengths James Cameron went to in order to make ""Titanic"" as historically accurate as possible, in terms of the events of the ship itself. The film is perfectly done in that way, as it is the most realistic film about the Titanic ever made, in my opinion. Nevertheless, it is not nearly a perfect film, and I'll tell you why. All the young girls in the world will kill me for this, but I feel that the film is far too focused on the fictional romance between Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). This is not the first time a fictional story has found its way into a Titanic film (take the 1953 version with Clifton Webb for example). Being such a buff on the real Titanic, I did not like how so much of the film was focused on this story. What I really wanted was true historical facts about the tragedy shown on film. The story does not really need to be spiced up. It is tragic and fascinating, with tons of little interesting details, all on its own. It is truly a great story simply written by God himself. If you enjoy the romance between Jack and Rose, you're not alone. That seems to be why most people love this film. Nevertheless, I found all of the facts about the Titanic in this film to be completely accurate and well-portrayed. It is a worthwhile film for just about anyone. Not worthy of all 11 Oscars, though. ""Good Will Hunting"" is what should have won that year. Of course, this does have that great original song ""My Heart Goes On,"" definitely worthy of its Oscar.*** out of ****",8
321,"A glorified sit-com, or soap opera.  This is one big hustle; I'm told it's the best movie ever...I must be from Mars.  It's an insult to 1500 who died in 1912, an insult to women, and a patronizing film in 1998.",1
322,"As I call it My favourite movie, this this still number one since I've watched it in the cinema in 1997! I probably watched it more than 50 times and every time feels like the first time. Till this day, i've never seen anything as good as it.",10
323,"It is a sad commentary on contemporary taste that this movie has received so much critical and popular acclaim. It is redeemed only by its admittedly spectacular special effects. The acting of diCaprio & Winslet is sophomoric. The romantic storyline is improbable and saccharine. The Billy Zane role harks back to the ridiculous mustachioed villains of 19th century melodrama - laughably unbelievable. The score is a disgrace; a movie which aspires so high deserves a symphony orchestra and a John Williams, not the synthesized tin whistle effort it received. The portrayal of social class (everyone in First Class is an evil, repressed, sneering Capitalist Oppressor while everyone in Steerage is a vibrant, life-affirming peasant saint) is right out of a Marxist primer. diCaprio teaching Winslet to spit over the rail is both ridiculous and disgusting. And as for Cameron's ballyhooed fetish for historical accuracy, there is absolutely no evidence that any ship's officer committed suicide during the sinking (but it sure works great on screen, doesn't it?!). Further, he neglects to give a name to the infamous ship that lay 10 miles away and watched the Titanic sink while doing nothing (it was the Californian). And this is the 90's so we have to have our obligatory and gratuitous nude scene and sex scene, don't we (can't make a film without one nowadays)? Those with an interest in the Titanic (possible as a result of this movie) are directed to Walter Lord's incomparable book on the disaster ""A Night to Remember"", and the 1958 J.Arthur Rank production of the same name. Although the effects are not as great (it's 1958 after all) they stand up well, and the script, acting and whole tone of the movie are superior to this bloated and overrated ""blockbuster"". And those who glibly call this ""the best movie of all time"" are gently advised to go out and rent one or more from the following list - ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Spartacus"", ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Citizen Kane"". ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"", ""Patton"", ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""The Quiet Man""....",4
324,"After many years, the second time to see the titanic, with the original state of mind is very different. The teacher said he saw it ten times, each time the feeling is different, I think, the next time, I will be what kind of feeling.
When the reality and dream conflict, when the desire and conscience on a log bridge, where to go? On the edge of life and death, the fear of the heart like drops of ink-stained gradually dispersed. What used to be called breeding, what is called integrity, may not be remembered at all at this time. The money, which had been so lordly in the past, was thrown roughly from a man's hand into the air like waste paper. The image of the aristocrat would not have any expression at this moment, only the flustered movements and hysterical crying.",10
325,"I have watched Titanic a number of times. The first being in the cinema in 1997, and the most recent last night (2020).It just never fails to move me in many ways. The disgust you feel at the egotistim and treatment of lower classes as well as the deeply engaging stories of those who were destined to be a part of history (in more ways than they ever bargained for), and the final abject terror watching the boat's demise makes this film a true rollercoaster of emotion.While the love story between Jack and Rose is fictional, and does take some 'Hollywood' artistic license, it adds a depth a richness to the story to allow you to empathise with many of the passengers on board. Watching it now, as a mother of young children, the Irish mother telling a fairytale to her two children as the ship is going down is infinitely heartbreaking in a way I didn't fully relate to the first time (I was 14). I think that is what makes this a timeless classic.The absolutely stunning cinematography of the ship's pride and beauty, intertwined with a great storyline full of interesting characters and a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack culminating in the ship's final dramatic and horrific hours still stands up 23 years later and always leaves me emotional and breathless. If you didn't know Titanic's true story, you'd be forgiven for thinking this was a far-fetched, over-egged Hollywood action film! For me, knowing it's a pretty close re-enactment of how the ship actually sank makes it all the more horrific to watch.I feel it would be easy for the next generations (particularly since the last survivor has passed on) to view the Titanic disaster as just another event in history, but I will encourage my children to watch this film not only because it's an enjoyable story, but to give them a true sense of empathy and compassion for the fellow humans that were part of the real version.",9
326,"This film mixes history (the sinking of the great ship in 1912) with fiction (a story of star-crossed young lovers on the ship: one, an artist with limited income; the other yearning to abandon the stuffiness of her upper-class background and a shallow fiancé).The 3-D re-release of this film was even more enjoyable the second time. The special effects are phenomenal. The scenes of the sinking ship are perfectly orchestrated and some images can't leave the mind such as the many bodies in the sea after the sinking. Seeing this film after 2001 is eerie; scenes of people jumping off the ship are reminiscent of the destruction of the World Trade Centre.The love story in the first half works well - mainly because of the fine work by actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Kathy Bates also makes the most of a small role.This is not to say the film is without flaws in the story. Did people really use the middle-finger gesture back in 1912? A rescue scene was perfectly directed but was also far-fetched. Also, the modern-day character who narrates the story in flashback fails to say what happened to one of her relatives.The story does well in exposing the injustices imposed by the upper-class whose descendants would be called ""the one per cent"" a century later. Their stuffiness is also exposed with good humour. But sometimes, the soullessness seems exaggerated.But these flaws don't dilute the great impact of this film. James Cameron's best work is in his directing rather than his writing. This is one of the rare big-budget Hollywood films of the past three decades that truly lives up to its expectations of greatness. - dbamateurcriticRating: 9 out of 10Award-Worth Achievements:

327,"I saw this one in the movie theater and kept cringing through the whole film. This film is so full of moments and actors etc. which done a little differently would have made me like the film, perhaps. The film isn't 'Gigli'-bad, it is fairly typical of Camerons new found style of making three digit milj. - budget films. I liked the original Terminator, it worked even if it sometimes looks a bit dated. The Titanic looks outdated already, and it doesn't have much going for itself except the remnants of the marketing campaign. 1/10.",1
328,"Titanic is now a film which people go out of their way to dismiss. Being contemptuous towards the film is the fashionable thing to do. Admitting you like the film marks you as being desperately uncool. Yes, the Titanic-mania of 1997-98 was a bit much. The box office records, the 11 Oscars...at some point people said enough was enough. But this is a film not so easily dismissed. Perhaps it was not worthy of the unprecedented frenzy which surrounded it. But it certainly does not deserve the derision it has received. It is a very solid film. A compelling story, beautiful visuals, stellar performances...this film has much to recommend it. James Cameron risked a lot to bring his vision of Titanic to the screen. The risks paid off. Titanic is great entertainment, truly captivating, at times legitimately thrilling. It's not a perfect movie, maybe it falls a touch short of true greatness but only by the thinnest of margins. All the hype, and all the eventual backlash, can't obscure the fact that this is indeed a very good movie.Of course this film is ultimately destined to turn tragic. But the film is not so much about the sinking of a ship. It is a love story. A very unique, heartwarming love story. A story about a young woman who found the love of her life. And found herself. All in the span of a few days aboard the ill-fated Titanic. Part of the film's charm is that this woman, Rose, tells us her story herself. 101 years old when we meet her Rose takes us back to the Titanic. And with her words she brings the great ship, and its passengers, back to life. One of those passengers is Cal, an arrogant man to whom, much to her chagrin, Rose is engaged. Her family needs Cal's money. Rose does not love him but family, and society, dictate she must marry this rather reprehensible man. But then things take a turn. Rose, in unusual and potentially embarrassing circumstances, meets Jack Dawson. While Rose enjoys first-class splendor Jack is a man from another world. A third-class passenger, no money to his name, no standing in society. Jack has no place in Rose's world. But, rather inevitably, Rose decides she wants a place in Jack's world. Yes, it is one of those scarcely believable stories in which a woman falls madly in love with a man she just met. But in her heart Rose knows. Jack is the one. She must follow her heart. She will throw away her privileged life to be with the man she loves. Unfortunately Cal is not going to give her up easily. But before this conflict can play itself out an iceberg intervenes.The love story of Rose and Jack is easy to embrace, especially when you contrast Jack, so good-hearted, with the vile Cal. Leonardo DiCaprio performs the role of Jack very well, making you believe there is so much more to this guy than is readily apparent. Jack is no ordinary third-class nobody and DiCaprio captures this unique individual wonderfully. But for as good as DiCaprio is it is Kate Winslet who is the real star here. Rose goes on an incredible journey of personal growth and Winslet nails it every step of the way. Rose is radiant, smart, witty and ultimately heroic. Winslet brings all those characteristics to the screen perfectly. Rose finds she is stronger, in so many ways, than she ever imagined. It takes a great actress to evolve along with such a character. And Winslet is clearly a great actress. For as good as DiCaprio and Winslet are in the two key roles the performance of Billy Zane as Cal, the main antagonist, leaves much to be desired. Zane takes Cal's villainy to cartoonish levels, by the end it's impossible to take the character seriously. Spitting his lines rather than speaking them Zane seems absolutely desperate for attention. Unfortunately the attention he brings upon himself is that of sticking out like a sore thumb in an otherwise stellar cast. Cal had to be evil to make the film's story work. But Zane overplays it so badly you half expect to find out that it was Cal who steered the ship into the iceberg and that he did it on purpose.Zane aside the rest of the supporting cast is excellent. While the lead characters are fictional there are many true-life figures aboard the ship. Some, such as ship builder Thomas Andrews, come across very well. Others, such as White Star Line managing director J. Bruce Ismay, do not. Whether those they portray are ultimately heroic, or quite the opposite, the cast by and large do an excellent job bringing these historical figures to life. And Cameron, with a great visual sense, beautiful sets, and state of the art effects, brings the ship to life. Titanic sails again. For the film to really work you had to believe you were really aboard a ship steaming across the Atlantic. Cameron makes it happen. We're right on board, right there with the passengers as they embrace the ship's majesty. And right there with them as the ship sinks to the bottom of the ocean. It is the love story which is at the heart of the film's success. But the sinking of the ship is spectacular, both haunting and thrilling. Perhaps the most fun sequence in the film comes when Rose wanders down to third-class where a raucous party is in full swing. We know that nearly all of those passengers are doomed. But Rose ensures they will not be forgotten. In telling us her story she tells us theirs as well. Through her Cameron has given a voice to all who were lost on that tragic night. Titanic is a film not without its flaws. But it is a film journey well worth taking. Three hours fly by as we follow the first, and last, journey of the great ship.",7
329,"I have given this film 1 because, for its time, the special-effects were truly excellent, and also because the costumes were and still are breath-takingly beautiful. I watched this film back-to-back as a teenager out of adoration for Leo, and now I am an adult I went to watch it again in 3D, expecting to be wowed like before. Oh dear. Themes of the film - ""Rich people are evil, all of them. Only poor people have feelings."" ""Cheating on your fiancé is fine, and he is not allowed to have any kind of reaction to this."" ""If we don't both fit on this wardrobe door, one of us will surely die...but let's only half-heartedly try once to fit us both...""Also, Kate Winslet is supposed to be 18!? REALLY!?!?!?!

331,"Voice of Dean Stockwell as Admiral Al Calavicci: ""Sam, Ziggy says you've leapt into one Jack Dawson of Chippewa Falls,Michigan and that there's a 78.5% chance that you're here to save the life of one Rose Dewitt Bukater."" Well, at least that's the way I see it. I may not see Scott Bakula or Stockwell, but for some reason I get the feeling that behind DeCaprio's pretty boy looks, it is Bakula as time-traveler Sam Beckett pulling his strings. I can just hear Stockwell after the nude drawing: ""You drew that while she was.....And I missed it?! Rats!!"" Back to the movie, it may be a chick flick for girls to see Leo, but it does have Kate Winslet for the guys. She looks incredible with red hair! Billy Zane should get an award for the sheer arrogance he plays (maybe it comes naturally) and David Warner should get the Jerk Reward for his portrayal as Zane's stooge. Exceptionally talented Kathy Bates is wonderfully likeable as Molly Brown, a far cry from her ""Misery"" role, but then she does excellant work in everything she does. Cameron pays a lot of detail into this work, or not considering the bloopers constantly being nick-picked. The story of two lovers separated by fate works well against the tragedy of the Titanic's sinking as does telling it from a past point of view at the site of a salvage expedition with Bill Paxton. I haven't seen him since ""Wierd Science."" The sinking is very well done. We just don't see a miniature sinking as have we seen in so many other movies, we see the drowning, the suffering, the deck going up, the sheer terror and true nature of the human spirit when faced with its mortality, the people fighting for life boats......this is the movie to put an end to further Titanic movies. Cameron has put together here not just an incredibly powerful movie, but a chick flick that even guys would want to see!",10
332,"Wow.  ""Titanic"" soars effortlessly through 3 hours and 15 minutes and yet you are not exhausted or tired at all.  In fact you may be wanting more by the end.  James Cameron reached new heights with this film and will always be remembered as the man who directed ""Titanic"".  From top to bottom the film is almost perfect.  Its special effects and minute details make it a real treasure to behold.  One feels as if they are really on that doomed liner.  The characters are excellent as well.  Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart delivered Oscar-nominated performances.  Overlooked, but equally potent was Billy Zane in a well-calibrated role.  However, Leonardo DiCaprio is just there it seems.  His character has mindless dialogue that does become tiring at times.  Despite that small problem it is not enough to keep ""Titanic"" from easily being one of the best films of the 1990s.  5 stars out of 5.",
333,"""Titanic"" is not only the most famous disaster film of all time, but also one of the most popular movies ever, not to mention that it achieved the rare glory of wining 11 Academy Oscars. Many ""Titanic"" films were made during the 20th century, but the famous James Cameron film from 1997 is the most well known.This film version of the legendary ship was a phenomenal and unusual success, so much that it was something like 7 months on theaters and proved to be the most cost-effective movie ever made. Many people even went to the theaters twice to see it. And the number of Academy Oscars that it won is another prove of its success. Plus, most everyone praised and liked the film back then. It was a hit on VHS and DVD as well.Strangely, in recent years the movie has been getting many lukewarm reviews and I read somewhere in the Internet that it was considered the worst Oscar winner ever. How ironic, huh? It seems that it has become fashionable to hate this movie.It's an okay movie, but not all that great. However, my biggest problem with the movie was always its length. 3 hours is too much and becomes tiring, even exhausting.The story is well known for being based in a real disaster story which happened in 1912. That makes this a realistic movie. The ship's replica is very well made and detailed. In that way they achieved perfection, making it look just like the real ship, which was the biggest, fastest, most luxurious and most beautiful of its time. Sadly it hit an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage and more than half of the people passed away. You know what bothers me most? First, the number of lifeboats wasn't enough because, stupidly, they believed that more lifeboats would be a waste of space in an ""unsinkable"" ship. Unsinkable? Yeah, right... Second, the ship was going too fast when its engines hadn't been tested enough... and all of this just because of headlines!""Titanic"" has beautiful instrumental music, a beautiful ballad named ""My Heart Will Go On"" sung by Celine Dion, beautiful angles of view of that pretty ship, romance, tension, suspense and incredibly tragic moments. To see people falling in despair and committing suicide is a reality and it certainly happened in real life. This movie also contains some nudity and sex and even some shocking and controversial scenes of homicide. However, it's not just a melodrama. It has also romance and even some moments of comedy.Besides, to see the Titanic sinking, breaking in two and to see its rear at an impressing height is breathtaking. It will live forever in your mind because it's very impressive. Spectacular, yes, but tragic.The actors do a good job in their roles: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Victor Garber, Danny Nucci, Jason Barry, Bernard Fox and others...By the way, Mr. Andrews, Jack Dawson, Fabrizio and Tommy Ryan are the best and nicest characters of this movie.Another equally revolutionary ship was the french ocean liner SS Normandie in the 30's. Its appearance was very similar to the RMS Titanic and inside it followed the same concept of luxury in a classic and old fashioned style, very different from the luxury standards of modern liners. The SS Normandie didn't sink, but its ending was tragic too. During the World War II, it was was converted to a troopship in 1942, caught fire, capsized and sank at the New York Passenger Ship Terminal. Although it was salvaged at great expense, restoration of the vessel was deemed too expensive, so it was scrapped in 1946. And I say ""it"" because I don't like to refer to the ships as ""she"".",6
334,This is a great movie from beginning to end. Everyone in it is fabulous. I'm not a movie person but I thought the cinematography and the cameras were brilliant.

336,"The start was very Disney like.Very bad dialogue and very condescending.But I was patient and I found the movie turning into gold with every passing minute starting with the scene where Leonardo was dining with the rich people,then from then on the film just kept impressing me.The movie started loosing it's Disney compromises with every minute passing.This movie could have been perfect with a better start,particularly with the dialogue.But after all the positive things this movie has shown,it has my blessings as a bonafide classic.Very depressing though.Very sad story but that was intended and the love story had it's power thru the tragedies around it.One would expect tragedy with a movie regarding this sort of historical disaster anyhow.It reminds me of another romantic movie with a very tragic ending that I love which is ""A Place In The Sun"" with Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift.But I accepted the tragic end of that one becouse it was made clear that Clift confessed to murder in one form or another.But Leonardo in this movie was such a gallant heroic young man that it depresses us to see him end that way.I'm not a nut for depressing romantic movies but I can appreciate them.This movie won me in the end.It also had one of the most suspensefull scenes I have ever seen.I was literally sweating and could hardly contain myself when Leonardo was being rescued from those handcuffs!This movie had that classic magic indeed.........",10
337,"Back at the 90s when I was a little child, I loved all of the films that came out at the time, but I never heard of James Cameron before until at 2009, when that guy made his sci-fi epic ""Avatar"", I saw it and loved it as much as anyone else despite it's flawed story (loved the concept, by the way) and considered one of the best movies James Cameron has ever made since the first two Terminator movies (I've watched them and I thought they were completely epic) and Aliens. So, I decided to watch this on a VHS copy that I used to have until it vanished and I was officially moved by it.Before I could get to the positive aspects, I've heard some criticisms from other people who said that this is an extremely overlong and overrated film. Well, I will admit that this film does have some flaws, they're outweighed by it's redeeming qualities. The three hour length is longer, but I was impressed at how the it moves very quickly and the script, while staying true to the tragedy of the ship, has it's cheesy moments. The film looks very pretty and the look of the ship is beautiful. It also has some gorgeous costumes and very solid special effects. The music from James Horner is lovely and is one of his best scores in a feature film so far especially the heart-rendering song ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion and is one of the best music songs in cinema history.The direction from James Cameron is amazing and helps the story with complete focus while giving a intriguing atmosphere to it. The story is very rich in detail, gives the characters a lot of development perfectly and the love story, while obvious, is really moving. The strongest aspects, however, goes to the climax of the movie for has drama, heart, and comedy perfectly mixed together and a flawless cast to make the characters more interesting, emotive, and likable. Leonardo Di Caprio gives out one of his best performances as Jack Dawson, Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose, and Billy Zane is a great villain due to his deliciously cartoony and over-the-top performance. Other actors like Kathy Bates, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, Bernard Hill, and more did well with their roles and the character development along with their interactions with the main characters were amazing.Overall, Titanic isn't nearly as excellent as James Cameron's previous films, but this is a beautifully moving and a 15-year old epic film that will always be recommended to others as one of the best movies ever made in cinema. With all my heart, this deserves a thumbs up from me.",8
338,"Before this film, the director, James Cameron was best known for action thrillers such as Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss and True Lies  all of which delivered the goods for action fans. After sitting through Titanic, however, I think he should have stayed with the true action-thriller genre, because when you mix genres, you can get mixed results. And, in this case, it shows...The story of the Titanic is well known: an 'unsinkable' ship sinks on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in 1912 with most of the male passengers dying. Cameron, using the technical wizardry he'd perfected in his earlier works, made you feel as though you were actually there, instead of being a mere spectator; the special effects are truly stunning. For action fans, that aspect of the film is relatively brief, however, because the bulk of the film and the very contrived plot are more concerned with the recovery of a fabulous jewel  a symbol of love -- from the existing wreck, left there by the heroine, Rose (Kate Winslet) with her all too brief lover, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) who perishes as the ship sinks. How the two lovers come together in the film and how the jewel comes to have so much significance forms the basis of the plot; the details of the sub-plot  the actual events leading to and including the sinking -- are mere props to the overall story of first love. The metaphor is thus complete  as the ship sinks on its first voyage, so also first love sinks.All of that is explored in flashback, as a burgeoning love between two people who would not otherwise have met, anytime, anywhere else. So the actual loss of the Titanic is, in that sense, incidental to the greater loss suffered by each and every person who lost a loved one in that tragedy. To that extent, the film succeeds in its presentation but only because of the calibre of the acting. As an account of the tragedy of the Titanic, however, it's a misnomer and a failure; while, as entertaining escapism  well, as the saying goes -- nothing succeeds like excess.To find out how the tragic event actually happened, you'd be better off getting a copy of A Night To Remember (1958) from your video store instead.",5
339,"It's been a long time since I last watched Titanic. I remembered some questionable dialogues and scenes from the last time I watched but what I had missed was something I had forgotten. The true essence of Titanic. The unending love for the story told in a way it was told. For another eight years, I was ignorant to it.
I recently saw a clip of Titanic which got me pumped to watch it again. I started watching with my brother who never liked Titanic for reasons I couldn't understand.
This time, not only did I remember what I missed, I felt the love with which it was made. Such magnificence. The story, style, chemistry of the actors and the characters being played, direction, score. Everything blended together to show why Titanic was ever popular! By the end of it, I was almost in tears with even the one watching with me praising it. And I finally witnessed what I was missing... Titanic. The way the story is told to eventually end on a note which would bring anyone to tears. It's perfection and to describe my experience in words in really difficult. I was enchanted, happy, sad and whatnot!
This is a timeless masterpiece and will continue to be for all times to come.",10
340,"From the beginning to the end.... This film is a masterpiece. I love everything about it. It includes magnificent acting, beautiful music, set designs, and costumes.

I appreciated the depiction of how terrifying, sad, and tragic the Titanic was when it sunk and many lives were lost that day.",10
341,"In Titanic the story is secondary to the film's fantastic photography and incredible visual effects. Titanic is easily one the most beautifully photographed films ever. While the story is rather slow in the beginning, it more than makes up for it in the last half of the film with the sinking of Titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers the best performance in the film, while Kate Winslet does a good job with the little bit her character is given.",9
342,"At over $1.8 Billion worldwide (excluding rentals), `Titanic' is the most commercially successful film of all time.  That is double the next highest grossing film (Star Wars: The Phantom Menace).  Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, it won 11 including best picture in 1998.  Everything about this film was big.  It ran over 3 hours and had a budget of $200 million which is larger than the U.S. box office for all but 30 movies in the history of filmmaking.  This was a TITANIC film in every sense of the word.  But, was it any good?  Well, actually it was!The film was written and directed by James Cameron, who before this was most renowned for writing and directing `Terminator' films.  The story was a combination love story, period piece and disaster movie.  As a love story was good.  As a period piece, it was wonderfully precise in its myriad details, both generally and as to specifics about the Titanic and her passengers.  As an epic disaster movie, it was utterly colossal.From a directorial perspective, this film is unparalleled; a feat of gargantuan proportions.  In addition to the normal directorial duties, Cameron had to coordinate mammoth model-building projects, deep sea filming of the original ship, thousands of hours of painstaking research, elaborate visual effects, and hundreds of special sets.  To be able to pull all those elements together at all is a superhuman task.  The result was truly remarkable entertainment.Cameron took a chance on Leonardo DiCaprio.  The studios wanted Matthew McConaughey but Cameron insisted on DiCaprio.  It was a gamble that paid off.  DiCaprio gave a career performance and his enthusiasm and charm lit up the screen.  Kate Winslet was also a fresh talent with only five minor films to her credit before Titanic'.  Her performance was sparkling and her chemistry with DiCaprio made the love story urgent and magical.  Oddly, she hasn't worked much since, and is fast slipping back into the obscurity from whence she came.This was not as much a film as it was a fluctuation in the space-time continuum.  Forces and emotions from the original event were transported to 1997, and they clutched us with a power that left us spellbound.  It was neither the best story ever told, nor the best film ever made, but it was certainly the greatest filmmaking achievement to date in its sheer size and scope.  As a motion picture, I rated it a 9/10.  As an epic, there is no scale large enough to rate it.  The box office speaks for itself.",9
343,"Yes, it's the best movie of 1997. Great special effects, great actor direction, great actors, great..., great...., When a movie combine comedy, action, romance and spectacular effects, it's a blockbuster.",10
344,"Titanic was not as good as I was hoping it to be.... I was disappointed in the film. I want to like this film because Leonardo DiCaprio is in the film because I like him - he's a great actor! But I could not get past the fictional romance the movie was focused on. I was hoping for more of a documentary type of a film but, alas, it was not so.The casting and acting was quite good! The set was realistic as well. There are good moments in the movie so I can't knock it completely.IDK, maybe I will have to be alone and in a romantic mood to enjoy this movie more than I actually did the first couple times I viewed it. Or, maybe, I really did want a modern documentary type of movie on The Titanic.I hate to dislike this film but I do. It's a movie I should at least like better than I do but I do not. I have to rate the film low due to the fictional romance the film was focused on.6/10",6
345,"This story is the only one that can share the words interesting and sad, as for the movie its amazing. I would definately recommend checking this movie out it is a sad one but does have some incredible moments.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are the stars and they done a great job.Highly Recommend.",10

347,"This movie is my number one favorite of all time. The acting, production, music, story, special effects... I could just talk all day about everything that makes this movie amazing. I've seen it so many times that I know every line. I love Jack and Rose and their chemistry and how their lives intertwine and change each other's. Just definitely a movie that can't be topped!",10
348,"It's almost too easy to bash this film. So I'll just paraphrase what James Cameron himself said on TV one night about the ""pitch"" meeting for the film...""I got an idea for a film about a boat. It's about 3 hours long and nothing much is gonna happen for about 2 1/2 hours. Then everbody dies and there's no chance for a sequel. And by the way..it's gonna cost you about $200 million to make it. Whaddya think, guys?""Truth be told..the first half hour or so (the Bill Pullman stuff with actual footage) ain't bad, but nothing I haven't already seen on the Discovery Channel. I'll still take Cameron's ""The Abyss"" every day and twice on Sunday. The guy directs a pretty neat little action film. It's just that I like my disposable love stories served with a side order of humor..and maybe some actual ""acting"". You know. The stuff that actors do in movies? In ""The Abyss"", Ed Harris and the gang got into their characters enough to give the movie a nice kick. Leo and Co. are reduced to playing second fiddle to blue screen effects.And here's another shining moment for the Oscars. Ranks right up there with the Milli Vanilli Grammy Award in the ""What the hell were they thinking, anyway?"" category.",7
349,"I cannot for the love of God, believe how extremely OVERRATED James 
 Cameron's pile of garbage known as Titanic is! This film, which should 
 have been about the actual sinking of the great luxary ship Titanic, 
 instead relies on a 90210 idiotic love story to ""carry"" the picture 
 through. IF the two main characters had been interesting, it might have 
 been a better picture, but, alas, the two leads, Jack Dawson, and Rose 
 Bukater are about as interesting as watching paint dry. Rose isn't 
 suffering from oppression, she's suffering from SPOILED BRAT syndrome! 
 Jack comes along like a teenage pretty boy rather than a compelling 
 character that the audience relates to.
 
 The film does have a few assets such as costume design, and some of the 
 special effects are pretty good. However, it's the whole script and 
 it's 90210 meets the Titanic setting that makes this the most OVERRATED 
 film in the history of motion pictures! This film grossed $600 million 
 in the United States?!?! James Cameron must have put mind altering 
 drugs into the prints of the film to hypnotize movie audiences and 
 academy members who gave this stinker Best Picture of 1997 over the 
 great L.A. Confidential.
 
 One on a scale of 1-10. Great costumes and special effects cannot make 
 up for a ridiculous screenplay and dull leads. Want a great motion 
 picture try L.A. Confidential, or Citizen Kane instead!",1
350,"""Titanic"" was the cinematic phenomenon of the 90's and the worldwide highest grossing film of all time before being dethroned by ""Avatar"", from James Cameron (the only director who could ever beat James Cameron in the box-office). Now, ""Titanic"" has become the quintessential cool-to-hate film, hence one of the most controversial Best Picture winners, which is surprising because if anything, the movie screams 'Best Picture'. There's something quite unique in the way the huge success of ""Titanic"" became a defining key of detestation, challenging any attempt for a rational appreciation. Well, we're in 2011 now : the hype has passed, CGI became a tiresome trend providing a series of unoriginal special-effects-driven films, Kate won an Oscar and Scorsese injected some cinematic botox on Leo's ex-pretty-boy face. In these circumstances, I believe we have enough distance to judge ""Titanic"" again, regardless of all the peripheral elements that contributed to its success, back then, in 1997 When ""Titanic"" was released, I was the kind of teenager who avoided any mainstream phenomenon, needless to say that I categorically refused to be brainwashed by the ""Titanic"" wave. The film was the absolute must-see and the girls were all drooling over Di Caprio, and you couldn't listen to the radio or watch TV musical programs without having the annoying flute of Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"". I was far from imagining that this music would define my personal nostalgia of the late 90's. Then the movie grabbed 11 Oscars, it was the most watched and re-watched film ever and I even had to make an essay about ""Titanic"" at school, where I eagerly expressed that the 'Iceberg story left me cold'But suddenly something strange happened. The bubble of popularity popped, some little fellows displayed a childish pride of having disliked the film. And I can't count how many girls were so pleased to say that Leo was too girlish, when one year before, he had an 'angel face'. Then I reversed my position, and from the enthusiasm of having avoided the film, I wanted to understand why people were being so hypocritical with their own appreciation, and feel guilty as if they admired a naked Emperor, with all flash and no substance. This is how ""Titanic"" gradually became the 'cool-to-hate' film, because it's always cool to hate popular stuff, but it's so uncool to try to be cool so this was my personal encouragement to give it a chance in 1999, and to know where I stood for. I came, I saw and I liked it.I'm not even afraid to admit that I loved it, it had everything I was expecting, it was spectacular, thrilling, romantic, and didn't rely too much on special effects except for the terrific sinking part. Yes, the film flirts with cinematic clichés sometimes, the whole 'follow your heart' message is almost Disney-like, but this is the point of the film, it's the romance with the Titanic as a setting, not the Titanic's story featuring a romance. When we think of ""Titanic"", we have less the image of the ship breaking in half in our minds, than Kate and Leo flying over the sunset, this is the defining image of the film and one of the most iconic of American Cinema. And this is the strength of the film.A few recent movies have managed to achieve a classic status so quickly, and so impacting the way ""Titanic"" did and this is certainly due to the constant symbiosis between the story and the special effects that provided the 'classic' vibe, and whether it was intentional or not, it sure succeeded. ""Titanic"" has the thrills, the romance, and an inspirational message, simple enough to appeal to all the sensitive hearts all over the world. And seriously, let's not get too cynical about the marketing campaign, and deny the artistic value of some of the most financially successful films. There's a time for Independent films and another one for spectacular blockbusters  as long as there is a good story, justifying the use of special effects, and the exhilarating sinking sequence.""Titanic"" had the intelligence to have a sort of classic story that could appeal on a universal level. A love story undermined by a tragedy, it's sad and inspiring, a love story between a rich aristocratic woman and a third-class youthful and optimistic boy, it's universal, the whole tragedy of the ""Titanic"" has been touched by a cinematic grace that made it one of the greatest American classics, and I mean 'great' in the classic meaning of the world. And I better take an innocent story, even naive, rather than a spectacular but dull one, like ""Independence Day"" one year before or a thought-provoking but manipulative one, like ""Saving Private Ryan"" the year after. So, I loved ""Titanic"", I felt for the characters, the part where one mother reads a story for her children while the ship sinks will haunt me forever, the music beautifully conveys the innate sadness of a rather passionate romance. The film revives the greatest tradition of the disaster genre with a perfectionism that finally paid-off, and I applaud James Cameron for that. And now, I wonder what the haters hate in the film, what makes ""Lord of the Rings"" so deeper than ""Titanic"", love story, good vs. evil? Don't they miss the young Leo who could smile and shout even the cringe-worthy ""king of the world"" line? Regarding the actual cinematic trends, ""Titanic"" is a classic among the classics and the deserving Best Picture of 1997.So, I don't find any particular reason to hate this film, and if I ever found one, let's say  uh, the part with the necklace which I didn't really care for, well, for one reason to dislike the film, I can find ten to love it. Disliking ""Titanic"" just because it was once so popular is simply a titanic mistake",9
351,This movie is about a love story that ends by the hands of an evil iceberg.Titanic was more about romance then about tragedy. The old lady and Jack are pure fiction only the iceberg was real.I say enjoy a good hour of watching people suffer because of an iceberg.,6
352,"Titanic is exceptional. This is what a real film is all about. The love story topped the icing on the cake for me, It's increasingly sad and all the while you still know what's the come. It's a real treat to be able to watch, the theme of the film is self explanatory; however there is so much to it. Regardless whether the love story is true or not, it doesn't matter because without this it would not be as emotionally galvanising as it is. It's astounding. It's obvious that Jack dies at the end and Rose is very upset. It's a brilliant film, def a classic! Highly recommended to anyone looking for something to weep at for days! Enjoy.",10
353,"So this is basically a typical story where a old woman who reminiscence about her past and tells the story on it. So the love story actually goes like this, poor class man wins ticket for the titanic in a game of poker (I think its a game of poker) and rushes to get on the boat that is about to leave. So when he is on the a couple of nights goes by and he sees a higher class woman trying to attempt to commit suicide by standing threating to jump of the ship into the deadly ice water. So after he intervenes and stops her from doing this they then get to know each other and fall in love.But as this is just another higher class meets lower class love story the thing that got me was just the amount of innocent deaths that was caused some guy not spotting a bloody gigantic ice berg in front of him which then leads to ship sinking and drowning thousands of innocent people.I personally loved this movie it is a real tear jerker, You will be joining in with rose and telling jack not to let go at end of the movie. It does tug on your heart but I do have to say this if your wanting a romantic disaster movie to complete your night then this is the film for you.",8
354,"Titanic wasn't the first attempt at turning the sinking of the big boat into a theatrical epic, but it's by far the best and will never, ever be bettered. Cameron's minute attention to detail, commitment to realism, and epic vision are light years ahead of the German Propaganda version, a Night to Remember (where the ship sinks whole), the dull Catherine Zeta Jones version, or the tawdry ITV mini-series.The hugeness of the production is every bit as impressive at the ship, and the savage critics predicted that the film was doomed to fail as hard as its subject matter. Nope! Titanic went on to be a $2 billion hit and scoop 11 Academy Awards.Despite the many positive reviews there are always film snobs who love to pick faults in popular culture phenomenons. But I think Titanic is more than that and doesn't deserve any nit-picking. It's easy to focus on inconsequential details, but Titanic has few faults. The worst I can say of it is that Leo DiCaprio's acting is sometimes a bit aggravating. Apparently Macauley Culkin was considered for the part of Jack Dawson. Now THAT was have been awesome.Many snobs have called the characters flat and uninteresting. It's hard to develop such a wide cast in a film set within a short space of time (not including the 84 year time-span of the story). But the two and a bit days that the ship manages to sail before it sinks does have plenty of drama and development so anyone who complains otherwise is just deliberately being fickle. I don't even think that Billy Zane comes across as a caricature, as others have gleefully pointed out. Caledon Hockley IS actually a complex, and somewhat sympathetic character. I know he's the antagonist (or maybe the iceberg is), but the fact that he still searches for Rose on the deck of the Carpathia means that he really does love her, in a way.Once the iceberg hits, at the 100-minute mark, the editing and timing (not quite real-time, but close) is perfect. The growing panic matches the rising water as Captain Smith walks around in a daze, completely unable to be believe that it REALLY IS HAPPENING. The hole in the hull doesn't seem to be a problem at first, but two hours later anyone not on a lifeboat is doomed.In a way it's an end-of-the-world movie as much as a romance or disaster. The Titanic was a microcosm of human society, and despite its status as the biggest ship ever built it really was a tiny, fragile speck on a dark, unforgiving ocean. Even as a child, long before I ever saw the film, I thought that the sinking of it represented the futility of mankind trying to conquer the ocean and the meaningless of wealth.It's a very different film from Terminator or True Lies, but James Cameron has always kept a gritty, earthy tone to his movie. Titanic isn't, but his commitment to realism keeps it consistent to his other movies.I don't think it's the best movie ever, but it scores almost full marks for everything. Titanic deserves to be seen on the big screen, which is why I have only seen it twice. The new 3D conversion looks great, and with a few corrections to the content of the film, and the digital projection itself, now really IS the time to revisit the ship.",8
355,"Titanic (1997, Dir. James Cameron) Brock Lovett whilst investigating the wreckage of the Titanic, when he discovers a diamond, known as 'The Heart of the Ocean', as well as a drawn picture of a woman. An old lady contacts Lovett, claiming that she is the woman in the picture. What follows is a breathtaking story of Rose DeWitt Bukater on board the Titanic. On board she meets a poor boy named Jack Dawson who both fall for each other. Day's later, they both must try to survive when the great ship hits an iceberg and goes down deep into the ocean.If you ever want to see one of the best film-making examples, then 'Titanic' is one of them. Some of the lines might feel a bit cheesy and the love story lines might feel a bit too much love filled, but just watching it was an amazing experience, and i was only watching it on a DVD. The fact that the film is based on something which actually happened, makes it so tragic and so emotional to watch. I'm not normally an emotional guy, but i just felt devastated seeing everyone happening on it. The music doesn't help prevent the emotional experience, as it's some of the best music i've heard on dramatic sequences. The special effects are also amazing too with some amazing realistic shot of the ship. A lot people seem to be put off by this film, but i think its a work of movie making at its best.""Is there anybody alive out there?"" - Fifth Officer Lowe (Ioan Gruffudd)",10
356,"I must be the only person on Earth who hated this movie. It was long and boring. If you can stand sitting for 3 and a half hours just watching Leonardo Dicaprio complain because he's in love with a girl thats too classy for him, then this is the movie for you. The only reason this made so much money was because of that Dicaprio guy and not the fact it was a good movie. If you want to see a good movie that involves a ship sinking at the end, watch Jaws. At least that had excitement. I have to say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen >",
357,"*POSSIBLE SPOILER, BUT ONLY IF YOU'RE STUPID*Hey, I'll save you who are considering seeing this movie a few hours.  The ship sinks.  And DiCaprio can't act.Too bad all this money wasn't spent on something beneficial, like figuring out how to fill all those holes in Swiss cheese.This movie's financial success is proof that our society is beyond hope.",
358,"Why did James Cameron go to so much trouble making a film that presented the physical and visual dimensions of Titanic and take the human dimensions on a fantasy-romp of titanic-sized contrivances? There are enough historical documents and memoirs about REAL people on that ship who had REAL lives and some were actually very compelling.  So why did Cameron opt to give these REAL people bit parts and invent two shallow characters? 
Good acting and high production values go a long way to cover up a poor script, and Titanic is proof of that with the Oscar frenzy that surrounded it (However, it was the first film in a long time that did not earn a screenplay nomination and won best picture).  Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet both did excellent jobs acting as did Gloria Stuart and Kathy Bates. They all deserved an Oscar in light of what they had to work with on the page.  How conventional, shallow and contrived does this sound?  Rose is in what is for all intents and purposes an arranged marriage, but she is really a free spirit ready to fly away from her upper-class roots.  If it wasn't for her darn mother.  Now to make this issue even more clear, her fiance is controlling and abusive.  The decision is clear.  She has to fall for Jack, a fellow free spirit who shows her real love.  Alas, Jack must be symbolically sacrificed so she can avoid being drowned in her life and truly find freedom in the new land.  Not only are the mechanics of the script clear, but the story is old and tired.  Titanic works because it plays on stereotypical conventions and latent emotions; it does not earn its emotional climax on its own merit.  This subject has the opportunity to be so much more genuine and powerful if only someone had taken the time to look beyond fictional romance and into true life tragedy.",
359,"Titanic opens with Brock Lovett (Paxton) and his crew as they begin to dive down 12,500 feet to the wreckage of the R.M.S. Titanic, which struck an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic Sea on April 15, 1912.  The movie jumps from present day, to the day of that ill-fated voyage, then returns to the present day.  That unfortunate day begins with Jack Dawson (DiCaprio) winning a ticket to ride the Titanic back to America where he is from. While on board, he meets Rose DeWitt Bukater (Winslet), a woman being forced to marry a man she does not love.  While on board, Jack and Rose develop a loving relationship, and spend all their time together hiding their feelings from all those who oppose.  Titanic follows the two as they fall in love, evade the jealous ex-fiancé, Cal Hockley (Zane), and eventually watch as their very short time begins to come to an end due to the sinking of the great Titanic. 	Of the many characters that went through changes in Titanic, I chose to discuss Rose DeWitt Bukater, and why she represents a three-dimensional character.  When we first are introduced to Rose, we get the impression that she is a little `rich bitch.'  She pulls up on the boarding dock in a caravan of new cars, welding a barrage of luggage.  When she first lays eyes upon Jack, who is on the lower deck with the rest of the `commoners', she has already formed her inferior opinion of him.  It is not until Jack stumbles onto Rose attempting to leap from the aft of the Titanic, and saves her, does she begin to realize that he is not inferior, and instead an interesting man.  Rose soon begins to fall in love with Jack, and this is where we see her change from that `rich bitch' to a caring, lovable woman. We later find out that even though she let go of Jack by the end of the film, she carried the memory of him her entire life through the beautiful necklace she wore as Jack sketched her portrait. 	 Titanic is filled with irony, symbolism, and conflict.  The fact the Jack Dawson won his ticket to ride on Titanic, only to perish on it's very first voyage, is the first taste of irony that we experience.  Also, how heartbreaking is it that just after finding true love, they are split by the death of Jack?  Tragic. 	The greatest use of symbolism in Titanic occurs within the scene where Jack attends the dinner with Rose, Cal, and others.  This represents the life that Rose is bound to, and desperately seeking to escape.  The opposite happens when Jack takes Rose down to the lower deck, and we witness Rose expressing her most comfortable, newfound personality.  We also cannot forget the use of the diamond necklace.  The necklace ultimately represents Roses' undying love for Jack, which she has held onto all her life.  Only after she visits the wreckage of the Titanic is she finally ready to let go, and subsequently releases the necklace to the sea, and passes on in her sleep. 	As with many of James Cameron's films, Titanic uses numerous close up shots to convey intimacy.  A perfect example of this occurs in the scene when Jack is drawing the nude form of Rose.  Another technique that I feel James Cameron has mastered is the use of sound and/or music in his films.  A right sound effect, or musical score as in Titanic, helps to complete that scary slasher scene, or that sad death scene, or even that scene where words just cannot express the right feeling as in that beautiful scene in Titanic when the lifeboat is being lowered with Rose inside. 	The film Titanic is such that in my opinion could be considered as having both a realistic and romantic ending.  The fact that Jack Dawson died at the end makes it a realistic ending; while having Rose walking to the rear of the ship to toss the ever symbolic diamond necklace into the night darkened sea creates the feeling of a romantic ending. 	Titanic proves to not only push the envelope, but break it wide open with the masterful direction by James Cameron.  While Titanic's photography would reason to be realistic, it is by all accounts formalist.   The use of distorted camera angles, wide-angle shots, and camera movements make it such. 	As I earlier stated, the use of a great musical score in any film will make, or break that particular feeling the director wishes to convey.  It is said that realists films employ minimal musical scores, while formalist films come with big scores that are hard to ignore.  Titanic not only has the critically acclaimed `My Heart Will Go On' theme song, but many beautiful scores such as `Rose' and `Southampton' which, in this reviewers opinion, is the main reason this movie was as beautiful as it really was. 	Costuming for Titanic was definitely elaborate and by itself is another reason this film is considered a formalist film. 	Lastly, the way the story and characters unfold is widely considered formalistic.  Formalist films are ones with courageous heroes (Jack) and beautiful women (Rose).  The story in Titanic took place on the biggest and most prestigious ocean liner ever built, which coincides with the fact that formalist films take place in exotic settings.  The only inconsistency that I have encountered with James Cameron's Titanic being measured a formalist film is the fact that it could be said that the film contains two different endings.  The first, by definition, could be considered realist because Jack Dawson ultimately died after the sinking.  Since the older Rose was shown tossing the necklace into the sea, achieving a final internal peace and showing that she is ready to let go and join Jack in the afterlife, it is my opinion this proves that it has a happy ending and hence should be referred to as formalist.",10
360,"Well, if you are reading this, HOW IS THE WEATHER ON MARS?  You see, in the early 20th century, there was this boat that sank...well you know.... This movie is the #1 highest grossing movie of all time, as well it should be!  I was going over some of the other reviews, and there were a lot of you who said this movie was very bad.  Well, I'll tell you what, give me your address, and I will buy you the glasses you obviously need!  Watch it again, and you will clearly see the greatest love story of all time coupled with some top notch special effects. Casting Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson was a great idea, but when I heard that someone named Kate Winslet would be the love interest, I said ""Who?"" Well, after seeing her in the movie she filled the role of an early 20th century woman. Great costumes added to the perfection of this movie!",10
361,"For me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time. No exceptions. James Cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller. Through films such as Aliens, The Abyss and both Terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science-fiction goes. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. But Titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance. The film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises, plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows. The story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for Cameron to make a truthful, interesting and entertaining film about it. The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films I get annoyed when the supporting characters aren't given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is Rose's and Jack's story alone, no one else. Emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home. The music has become iconic and legendary. It is composer James Horner's finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience. The song after so long has become annoying but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is. Only one problem, the usual James Cameron problem, is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime. My heart won't go on from this one.",10
362,"So many romance movies come out these days, and so many of them have characters, stories, and relationships that are hopelessly difficult to care about. Who could have guessed that James Cameron, known for highly visual works like Terminator and Aliens, would create what is in my mind unquestionably one of the greatest love stories ever? If I had gone into Titanic blind, I certainly wouldn't have. I will get the few real flaws out of the way first. Leonardo DiCaprio, as great as he is in this film, is forced to yell commands to Rose a bit too much. And the 3D is a gimmick, nothing more. However, to my knowledge, this is the only way to experience this film in IMAX, so for me at least, wearing the glasses was well worth it. Though I'm sure I am overlooking some, that's about it for the bad. On to the good. Firstly, I hope that the rerelease of this acclaimed film will remind directors of romantically-minded movies everywhere of how to do it right. James Cameron starts the film in the present day (or at least, it was when it was released), with an expedition to the titular wreck overseen by an enthusiastic explorer (Bill Paxton). He finds a bunch of papers in a safe on the ship, and restores a drawing of a young woman naked, wearing only a necklace. This sets into motion a series of events leading to a three hour long flashback detailing Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet, played in the ""present"" by Gloria Stuart), and her passionate relationship with Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). I could type for hours about how well-acted, emotional, and real this pair seems. I won't, but suffice it to say that all acting awards were well-deserved. For the bare majority of the film, Jack and Rose are in the spotlight. The length of the film actually works to its advantage, because ample time is given to see how their relationship springs, wilts, and ultimately blossoms. Jack is a lower-class man, and even he makes no bones about it. Rose is from the opposite end of the spectrum, and hates it. Jack finds he about to commit suicide over her marriage forced on her by her mother. The moments the two share really sell their relationship, enough so that the audience becomes invested as well. Class differences are an extremely prominent issue, brought up again and again. At one point, Rose reminds a frantic crewman that only half the ship's population can fit on the lifeboats. Her husband-to-be overhears this, and replies ""the better half."" The rich are not painted in a sympathetic light. They are arrogant, selfish, and terrible people that throw others off just to have themselves a little more space. Cameron goes this extra mile to ensure that we are sympathetic with Rose. She is forced to walk among these horrid humans, and finally, stumbles upon someone that treats her as an equal, and in an almost husband-like manner, as opposed to her stuck-up, borderline misogynistic fiancee. After almost two hours of engaging, superb relationship-building, the inevitable iceberg looms. This, of course, is where James Cameron's signature technical brilliance kicks in in full force. Metal is torn asunder, flooding commences everywhere, and there are many grand exterior shots showing the Titanic going down. All of which are done with excellent special effects that look as real as any of the characters in the midst of them. This is also where the movie becomes incredibly, brutally honest about what probably happened once the ship began to sink. Hundreds are shown drowning and falling, including children. The rich shun the poor, literally kicking them off lifeboats. SOS signals are sent, and fireworks are launched. And, in what could be the greatest scene in the film, four string instrument players lament the catastrophe the only way they know how. And through it all, Rose and Jack find each other through the worst of it, and stay alive until the last possible moment. James Cameron's work in this film is truly extraordinary. He is not known for crafting compelling characters or stories. However, in these respects, he succeeds brilliantly here. In modern romance films, characters and their tribulations are about as genuine as cardboard cutouts. Cameron has created a set, populated it with characters that fill it to the last inch, and bound it all together with great attention to artistic and technical detail. I left trying to sort out what I liked most about it. I haven't yet decided, but I knew then and know now that I have seen a beautiful masterpiece from the unlikeliest of sources.",9
363,One of my best film in all of my life and this film could conquest my heart.,10
364,This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Everything about it was EXCELLENT. The James Cameron really did a good job on this movie. The music was so beautiful. The plot was so touching and sweat. The character are excellently written. I don't know anything about this movie that I don't like. I recommend this movie to anyone who like a really good romance story. This is the most beautiful movie ever made.,10
365,"I have always been fascinated by the story of the Titanic, and I had high hopes for this film.  Unfortunately, what I got was a cold, mindless Hollywood romance flick that merely used the Titanic as a springboard to emptier things.I found it less than moving.  The romantic storyline was nothing new at all, and the acting and dialogue was generally laughable.  What did work?  It has lots of pretty faces, elaborate set-design and special effects, plus looks and feels 'epic' (with no substance to back it up).Just a big, empty romance-disaster movie here.  If your interested in the story of the Titanic, read about it in books, there is little here we don't already know and the focus is mainly on the characters, who are no more than one-dimensional stereotypes.",
366,"So, how do you spend vast amounts of money on a film and still wind up with a dreadful (albeit profitable) end product? Simple.You spend lots of money on beautiful sets and breathtaking special effects. You hire some very talented and/or (mostly or) attractive actors. Then you give those actors lines to speak that are so badly written they might have been written by a 13-year-old girl trying to emulate a Harlequin romance.Despite wonderful production values and a serviceable story line, ""Titanic"" may be painful to the ears of anybody who is fully literate. Why did James Cameron spend so many millions to make a film and not spend an extra ten grand to have a competent editor look at his script? Writing the ""Terminator"" movies really was NOT adequate preparation for writing an epic romance.Gag me with a spoon! (Hmmm... did Kate Winslet's character say something like that in what was supposed to be 1912? Quite possibly!)",2
367,"Why does this movie suck so bad?  More importantly, why did it win an oscar for among other things, best picture?  There are so many holes in the film's plot, the villian is similar to one in a Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon (I was wondering why they didn't give him a mustache which he could rub between his fingers), the long sweeping shots of the ship look horrible, the script is lame and filled with cliched action movie lines and all of the scenes taking place in the present day are worthless and have no place.First, if Rose is telling this story from her perspective how is it that she knows what her fiance is always planning?  How does she know what the crew of the ship is talking about before and after the iceberg hit?  How is it that she knows how exactly Jack got on the ship or what he talked about with his friends onboard?  You get the idea?  Now many movies have this problem, but not a best picture winner. Second, the villian who's name escapes me.  He was so cliched.  So evil it was funny.  He's like Travolta in his new horrible film.Third, the fly over shots of the ship look like garbage.  They are so obviously fake, all the people appear as black, lifeless silohoettes walking the ship. Fourth, the script.  How did these horrible lines that Jack utters get in there?  When danger is afoot, no matter how great all he can utter is his best Keanu Reeves impersonation. Fifth, what is the purpose of showing us the salvage crew?  Who gives what these idiots are thinking or doing.  It further complicates things. Why would these people believe an elder Rose just because she says she is the one in the picture.  Anyone could call up and say that.  If they cut these parts of you have a much shorter film.I HATE THIS MOVIE.L.A. CONFIDENTIAL WILL ALWAYS BE 1997 TRUE BEST PICTURE",
368,"At first glance, Titanic is an epic film. The scenery and cinematogrpahy are spectacular, and it is just a beautifully photographed movie. However, when you look past the superficial beauty of the film, much like Armageddon, its numerous shortcomings become clear. First of all, Titanic suffered badly from the transition from the big screen to video. This took away a lot of the hugeness of the film, and this inadvertently places more attention on the story and the acting, both of which were the biggest problems with the film. I went to see this movie to see the sinking of the Titanic, not to see some elaborately fabricated love story. Titanic is a landmark film as a result of the sinking of the ship and the fact that it inexplicably turned out to be such a huge moneymaker. There is absolutely nothing great about the acting, the story is nothing that hasn't been seen dozens of times before, and the directing is awkward, probably due to the fact that James Cameron, who is an excellent director, is so used to directing the Frankenstein-like Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. This is not to say that the directing was bad, it wasn't at all, but there is nothing special to be said about the directing because James Cameron is not really a director of this type of film.Kate Winslet was beautiful in Titanic. She delivered a wonderful performance in the film and was very convincing, as was Kathy Bates (as always) and even Billy Zane. I normally don't like him, but he was playing a dislikeable character, which is probably why I enjoyed his performance so much. Leonardo DiCaprio, however, delivered the worst performance of his career. If you want to see him really act, watch The Basketball Diaries or, even better, The Beach. Titanic is a beautifully made film. It suffered in the story and the acting departments, but it is an entertaining and easy to watch movie. It was not, however, the best picture of 1997. Not even close. There were probably 20 movies that were released in 1997 that were better than Titanic, but the Oscar's wouldn't have gained as much public support had they not given the Oscar to Titanic. It was a quality film, but don't be fooled by all of the hype.",6
369,"I absolutely loved this movie in every single way possible. It's an absolute masterpiece. Makes you fall in love with ship named Titanic. A perfect balance of tragedy, romance and drama. It's emotionally so powerful that it breaks the viewer into tears.",10
370,"that is, by you IMDb voters. You seem to be the only people in the world to think this movie isn't great. This film is a masterpiece, which belongs in your top 250. It's the only 3 hour  movie that doesn't bore me. In fact, no one in the cinema seemed bored when i saw it. If you think that this movie is silly because of the dialogue, it's obvious you're all forgetting that this movie was made to entertain! It's the same thing with star wars: it's sort of a fable, and the dialogue is much cheesier than that of this film. It has great music, great special effects, great sound and fantastic cinematography. It was definitely the best picture of 1997, and Kate should have won the best actress award.",10
371,"Titanic is the fictional love tale of a rich girl and a poor boy falling in love on the 'unsinkable' ship destined for New York City, from Europe. Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a poor boy living in Europe, well just sort of hanging out in Europe in 1912. Outside the bar he hangs in, the largest ship ever built, the Titanic, is being set to sail. After winning an unbelievable card hand, he wins a ticket aboard and to America.While Jack camps out on the 3rd Level, Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) is spending some rough time on the 1st Level. While Jack spends his night on the deck, Rosw rushes past him, ready to jump off the boat and to her death. Jack convinces her not to jump and the two begin to spend some time together and slowly fall in love. But as the days slowly tick away an unknown obstruction stands in front of ship, just a few miles ahead. One obstruction that would set the ship into history.The film beautifully shot and wonderfully acting. The love story is better then most. Instead of two kids just meeting and having sex that night, Cameron took time to let both Jack and Rose develop and progress into the relationship. The dialog between the two flows easily and the love connection is strong and well-portrayed. The special effects are a bit overwhelming especially when the ship is sinking. My only fault with the film is its length. I don't have a problem when a film extends 3+ hours when necessary but this extending 3 was unnecessary. Too many scenes are shown of Billy Zane running around and could have been edited out. Other than that the film is perfect. The story is told with great detail and flows less like a history lesson and more like a love story. The film is quite gripping and overwhelming at some parts but is well-worth seeing.Titanic. Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, and Gloria Stuart.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",9
372,This film is probably my favourite. This is is heartbreaking and melancholy. The relationship between Jack and Rose is a life time. This film is Oscar-Winning and I recommend for 13 or above.,10
373,"I half-expected an overwrought concoction of incredible high drama, but James Cameron's fictionalized film of a real incident from 1912 is nearly free of derivative devices or sappy puppy love issues. Before the infamous ocean liner perishes in the icy Atlantic Ocean, two passengers--third-class gadabout Leonardo DiCaprio and conflicted first-class passenger Kate Winslet--fall in love in what is a very captivating romantic interlude. Cannily-made picture is, of course, full of marvelous effects, but its this key romance that most people will end up remembering (and with good reason, as the performers are terrific). Cameron's pacing is both giddy and tight, and he draws vivid characterizations from the supporting players as well. High entertainment. ***1/2 from ****",8
374,"Can we say predictable?  Can we say simplistic?  Can we say a badly told love story with NOTHING new that exists only to fill time before a roller coast sfx show happens?

Cameron did it for us and spent WAY too much money doing it.Perfect 1.  Nuff said.",1

Sailing on a boat or a ship like in ""LIFE IN THE MISSISSIPI"" is a waste of valued coal but the steam engine that crossed those days disappeared as well.",10

379,"The Irish plans to tow an iceberg to Belfast to commemorate the making of the Titanic seems a good enough reason to write a review of this movie.So here is the spoiler of this review. They build this big ship, they think it is unsinkable, it hits an icebergs and sinks. (Other breaking news, the earth is round, Christopher Columbus fails to get to India but discovers America).The true genius of this film is that it understands that movies take us to another place that we could not normally go but where we have a desire, either openly or secretly, to venture.We have all heard of the Titanic and how it sank. But do we really know what it would be like to be there, in the ""ruddy"" north Atlantic as the largest and safest ship sinks beneath you? James Cameron uses two methods to make this come alive. Firstly, and the most obvious are the sets and special effects. A full size tilt-able Titanic and CGI. Even though the CGI looks look computer graphics it is good enough to mean we don't really need to worry about it (I am sure in a few years they will run the computer models through better software and knock out a better print so Titanic fans can buy the Titanic experience all over again).The other technique is to create 2 fictitious characters that we care about who he put anywhere he wants during the sinking process so that we can really feel what is happening and meet many real people and see their stories.The movie is 3 hours long, but once the Titanic starts sinking you become involved in that part of the story as if it is a story starting afresh and your attention doesn't waver from that moment on.Overblown, pretentious film making that won the Oscar because that is what American films want to be. However it remains highly entertaining.",8
380,"I am 24, I watched Titanic for the first time with my mother at the tender age of 7 years old... no cause for alarm, we were taught to close our eyes in age restricted scenes, which I did (technically).Titanic is the best movie that I have ever seen, I have probably seen it about 500 times since it was first released and I aim to see it once a year at least till I die. The glorious tale of tragic love upon the maiden voyage of a doomed luxury liner. Every time I see Titanic, I see it in a new light, I notice something different that I never noticed before and I cry all over again.The beauty of a movie like this is that it has the ability to cripple the strongest of men with emotion. Being a skeptic on love myself, I have to say that I am slightly glad at Jack's demise not because he's a bad character (in fact he's my favorite character) but because there is some realism to that aspect of the story. Up until the doom of Titanic sets in, it's all very Romeo and Juliet, the obsessed illusion of true love after barely days of knowing each other, at least Rose is hesitant of it at first, whereas Jack is smitten beyond comprehension... Alas, their supposed true love does not overcome the wrath of a very angry looking iceberg and of course Ismay's blatant challenge to God and all elements of an unsinkable ship. That being said we all know the fate of Titanic but this is not what makes this movie so wonderful... it is actually the integration of all characters, both little and large, whether it be the distraught Murdock, the grief stricken captain EJ or the delightfully despicable Hockley... they all merge together in a beautiful picture.. while the main characters and those closest to them were made up and given a slightly mediocre presence, it all fits in so well, tragedy, love, jealousy, arrogance, greed, honor, dedication and lust all get together to dance upon the ship of dreams.Whether you're male or female I'm pretty sure the ""I want you to draw me like one of your french girls"" scene was a tasty reminder at how erotic cinema can be without actual sex. sensuality at it's tender best but not my favorite scene in the movie... the most notable scene for me in Titanic was when the poorer passengers accepted their fate of death, the Irish mother and her kids, the old couple that embrace as water floods around their bed... those were scenes dripping with emotion... My favorite scene however, is when Rose joins Jack below decks to party with the third class folk... just goes to show that money does not make-th the man, a good heart does.The marvel of the ship in all it's grandeur made me realize that Mister James Cameron is a visionary, the attention to detail of a simple thing like cutlery was admirable. Shining performances did not come from Dicaprio and Winslet as some foolish viewers believe the shining performers were Kathy Bates, Billy Zane,Frances Fisher and Gloria Stuart.I can go on about what a brilliant movie this is but I should not.End note, excellent movie that every person should see at least once before they die.",10
381,"This movie may or may not stand the test of time. Its theory of why the ship went down has since been replaced by a discussion of the fire down below. Its most indulgent moments have become the stuff of parody. But if we're going to judge this film, let's judge it by its impact on release. I saw it seven times before it left the theater. I was entranced by it. The performances were stunning, as was the cinematography and direction. It's a great story, about the folly of human beings and the absolute imperative of living your life while you've got breath in your lungs. I loved the chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet, but there were great performances as well from Billy Zane, Bill Paxton, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher and Gloria Stuart. I loved the use of music. I loved the whole thing. After you watch a film 900 times, you lose sight of what was great about it and all that remains is its imperfections. This was still a great ride.",8
382,"It's a crying freaking shame that this outstanding movie's rating has been dragged down by small people who hate it because it was successful. You should be ashamed of yourselves. When I first saw it I thought it was the perfect movie, and it's still one of my favorites 8 years later. It's got sexual tension, action, social commentary, and the acting doesn't suck. It's even got Bill Paxton, one of my top 10 criteria for a great movie. What's so horrible about it that it deserves an aggregate 6.9? The only reason I can think of is this perverse habit people have of hating anything that makes so much money or is otherwise successful that it makes them doubt their own worth. That's just sad, and you shouldn't take it out on an innocent blockbuster.",10
383,I thought Braveheart was the best movies of the 90s! Then Titanic comes along with an old story told in such a unique and great way! There was chemistry and magic on the screen from the time the two lovers met! I don't think it won enough Academy Awards!,
384,"Neither as good or as bad as the hype might have led me to believe.The love story is good and the special effects are good, but considering the material Cameron was working with he didn't really produce anything that another director might have with a similarly astronomical budget or possibly a whole lot less.This is definitely a film for the big screen or at least the biggest screen you have.",7
385,"Rose DeWitt Bukater is a beautiful young woman, travelling to America to be married to the dashing cad that is Caledon Hockley. Jack Dawson is a poor Irish kid with little hope of getting to the land of plenty  until, that is, he wins tickets onto a ship making that very crossing in mere minutes. Jack and his friend rush onto the boat and find themselves in 3rd class with all the rest of the poor people. Meanwhile, on the upper decks, the rich enjoy the space and pleasure that comes with privilege but yet Rose feels little happiness about her loveless prospects. A chance meeting between Jack and Rose sees them fall into a passionate instant love affair but time will show them that the class divide between them is really the least of their concerns.As others have mentioned, Titanic seems to have enjoyed great praise and great abuse. When it came out it was the biggest movie of the day, sitting at the top of the charts for months and also sweeping the Best Picture Academy Award for that year. However as time has gone on it has received more and more of a kicking from viewers and it has now lost a lot of the appeal and shine that it once had. To some this is just a simple backlash without basis but I'm not sure I agreed with that. Of course there is an element of wanting to tear down the ""success"" of the film and perhaps wipe that smug smile off James ""king of the world"" Cameron's face but for me a lot of the negativity comes from people seeing the film in the cold light of day, without the crowded cinema, without the hype, without the partner to hug up to while watching.So it is with me here. The first time I watched it I was with my partner in the front room of a packed cinema and allowed myself to be carried along by the sheer spectacle and not worry too much about the finer points. However watching it again I viewed it like I would any other film. As such the failings came tumbling out. The story is consistently weak whether it is the speed and superficiality of the central ""relationship"" or the roundly average dialogue within the script. Funny how a rush to sex is seen as romantic when it occurs in the movie whereas if the same tale was set in a Bolton nightclub, the view would not be the same! Part of the reason for this is the forced emotion and atmosphere of the film, with James Horner's manipulative score constantly on hand to tell us ""you're meant to cry at this bit"". This is very different from bringing the audience into the characters and the story in a genuine way and you are not getting into this car because you want to so much as being forced in with a hood over your head.Of course this is not so different from many Hollywood blockbuster, but it is particularly noticeable here because the script and characters are so lacking. Director Cameron cannot make up for the failings of writer Cameron and instead just injects as much of this manipulative schmaltz into proceedings as he can as he waits for his effects budget to kick in. When it eventually does there is no denying that it is impressive in terms of spectacle but I do wonder how this will hold up as the effects become ordinary, because there is little else for the viewer to feast on. Certainly the performances offer very little, mostly due to the material handed to them. DiCaprio is miscast. I know it has been said countless times before but he looks far too young for the part and, as he looks more adult in other films he looks younger and younger in retrospect. Both he and Winslet are capable of so much more but neither really work individually or as a couple. Zane hams it up as a ""baddie"" and actually seems to be having a good time of it unlike his co-stars. Bates, Fisher, Paxton, Warner, Amis, Hyde and others all fill round the edges with so-so performances.There is no questioning that this was a massive success and will stand up in lists for years to come. However the effects are already dating and, them to one side, there isn't a huge amount else to spend three hours on. The love story is clunky to match the dialogue and the actors can do little with it producing an unconvincing love story that is forced out with manipulative and exploitative methods that are exposed as such with a clear eyed viewing. A big film but not really a good one.",

387,"15 years after this classic first hit, it's back, and now it looks and sounds better than ever, and some recent releases look so muddy and artificial in comparison. Here Cameron uses his expertise to improve on the technical aspects of ""Titanic"" without sacrificing what already worked. Nothing gratuitously calls attention to the new ""3D"" transfer. Instead, it enhances the gorgeous and meticulously produced movie. The spectacle glows with renewed strength, and each performance, each costume, each set now looks remarkable, all contributing what a true cinematic experience should be.As everyone knows, our stars are not reciting Shakespeare. The focus is on the relationship, and how two young people connect with each other. Surrounding them is cast of real and fictional character that gives us a little insight into what it was like being in the doomed ship. People look and act the part. Each class defined by the parameters of their own creation. Cameron understands the passengers on this ride. Zane, Bates, De Caprio and Winslet all do remarkable work, and it's still a question why De Caprio wasn't recognized by his peers when the film first came out. He is central to the success of this confection.In the end, the film, like the title will go on, having us choke on the emotional highs, the times when we understand what gives us humanity and hope, and when we see that humans share so much and are so far from perfect, but we just keep on going, and we will have dreams even after the worst of nightmares.It deserves repeated viewings and much praise. Thank you, Mr. Cameron.",10
388,"I will never understand the common man, and therefore will never understand the mass hysteria over this movie.  I did not care about any of the passengers James Cameron took the time to introduce us to.  In fact, we know none of the true heart-breaking tales of the R.M.S. Titanic - only the fanciful romantic tale of a spoiled brat and the only American in steerage. It is frightening to me that America embraced this movie without ever learning one bit of true history about the disaster of the Titanic.  5 will get you 10 that most of America believes there was such a jewel as the Heart of the Ocean.  We already know many fools clamored around the graves of anyone known as Jack Dawson.  Most offensive, however, are Mr. Cameron's comments at the Oscars without any regard for the 1523 lives actually lost on the R.M.S. Titanic.  Life is not a movie, and love does not conquer all.",1
389,"Such a lot of care was taken, so I'm told, with most aspects of the accuracy of this movie. If that is so, I cannot understand why one of the most important facts is glaringly wrong, and that is the name of the ship. It was not the SS Titanic, but the RMS Titanic, i.e. The Royal Mail Ship Titanic.I could be wrong, but I think it must be taken with a pinch of salt that the sketch left in the safe could have really been in such pristine condition after 80 years at the bottom of the Atlantic, protected or no. It was an excellent movie in regard to the computer imagery, and a marvellous treat for those unfortunates who wallow in disaster for their entertainment. I'm not one of them, and only really watched it out of curiosity after all the hype. I couldn't see what all the fuss was about, and for me even the a pitiful sub-plot couldn't save it. It's not a patch on ""A Night to Remember"" and that was in black and white with no computerised aids. One last comment; I can well understand an upper class girl falling for a working class bit of rough, even in the second decade of the 20th century. What puzzles me is how they managed to enjoy love-making in Arctic conditions, and in the back seat of a freezing car. Brrr! It doesn't bear thinking about.",4
390,"Titanic:Number one box office takings of all time, by a mile. Special effects better than any other movie, ever.And nowhere to be seen on the IMDB voters' top 250.Why the disparity? Because Special Effects do not a Movie Make, and cannot cover the cracks in the pedestrian plot and the cardboard characterisation.The ultimate reputation of this film has been sunk not by an iceberg but a similarly immovable object; the judgment of movie-lovers.",1
391,"When Billy Zane took out his pistol and began firing at the fleeing lovers, I thought to myself ""Oh puh-leeeeze! We've got the biggest maritime disaster in history going on here and the director feels he needs to provide MORE drama?! And CONTRIVED drama at that?"" To me it just crystallized the absolute creative and emotional bankrupcy of this movie.",
392,"Ok, I borrowed that phrase from a person called Red Elvis but it was too good to ignore for this formulaic recipe.Mix together a bunch of cliches. Boy meets girl. Boat meets iceberg. Add social and ethnic stereotypes by the shovel. Stir in a heap of stodgy dialogue and a lot of very good and expensive special effects.Add a million gallons of salty water and what do you get? A mess that will make you nauseous.",1
393,"At the time, Titanic was the most expensive and highest-grossing movie of all time. It was also the first movie since Ben-Hur in 1959 to win 11 Oscars, which is the most. Since then, Titanic has become one of the most polar-opposing movies, as well as the second biggest as of now. (Avatar in 2009 is to thank.) The lovers of this movie clearly outnumber the haters because this movie has high ratings on every site. Even so, I still think that it deserves to be ranked higher in every site. Higher than Pulp Fiction or Vertigo? Maybe not, but you get my point. There are flaws in this movie that keep it from being perfect. Number one is the whole subplot with the diamond necklace. Old Rose (who tells the story) still has the diamond and throws it in the ocean at the end because she feels that's where it belongs. Why not give it to a museum? Or feed a country? Then there is Jack and Rose's names being mentioned countless times. Some more dialogue is pretty dumb and there are no instances of any powerful dialogue. But considering how many upsides this movie has, these flaws do almost nothing to effect the quality of the film, because all the positives erase the negatives.The story of Titanic is pretty much Romeo and Juliet on a ship. Jack is a poor, charming artist. Rose is rich and mistreated who gets saved by Jack in every way. Romeo and Juliet is a story that many people find stupid because two young teenagers fall in love, then kill themselves after two days of knowing each other. Yes Jack and Rose fall in love quickly, but there are no dumb suicides, so Jack and Rose are smarter there. People also criticize Rose's character as being a rich, spoiled girl who gets anything she wants. I for one, can relate to Rose's character. She struggles to be perfect and is forced into and world where wealth is number one and is being forced to marry an abusive man who only want to marry her to inherit money. Nobody understands her. She feels trapped. I can relate to Rose's feelings by her becoming what she does not want. Then Jack comes along who finally understands her. He gives her the courage to be what she wants. Jack is sensitive, patient, and fun. Sounds gay? Leo DiCaprio is such a good actor that he makes Jack seem real and cool. This is one of Leo's biggest powerhouse performances that still shines. Maybe Jack and Rose fell in love quickly, but if the ship did not sink, would they have gotten married right away? No. Just date for a few months then break up. If Jack would have lived, would they have gotten married? Maybe. Jack risked his life for Rose, and they did all they could to survive. Since they were part of such a huge impact on each other's lives, maybe they would marry. Maybe not. Not just Jack and Rose, but everybody is developed so well, you feel like you grew up with them. Very few movies feature character development this deep. Then the ship hits the iceberg. Titanic movies have been made that have all turned out well, but none have been spectacular in the sinking portion. The danger is high, sets are great, sympathy is drawn, etc. Then there is the score, which is so beautiful and so sad. It adds so much to the littlest things.People, mainly men, that don't like this think that they're too cool for it. Anybody that doesn't like this just fails at trying to be cool. Too close-minded to see into and beyond a love-story and too close-minded to see how good the song and score were. Maybe this is a fake story, don't try to get all smart and say how the ship really did sink. The acting is extremely strong, characters are developed so well, the disaster scenes are played out excellently, the music is so haunting. Haters should continue watching NASCAR and Delta Force 2. 10/10.",10
394,"Titanic is iconic film from different points of view. Firstly, the plot is interesting, it shows passengers' fates before the catastrophe. It shows that love doesn't understand social differences. It shows that richness is not enough for full life. Secondly, the cast is great, Leonardo DiCaprio does his work perfectly, Kate Winslet is the brilliant of film. Thirdly, action itself is awesome, it looks like Cameron destroyed the ship really.
So, it's amazing film for all times.",9
395,"The true reason that Jack has to die doesn't lie in the physics of surviving in very cold water, but in the inner logic of the story. Jack has to die because he exists in order to empower Rose and give her the will to live. And once that story purpose is fulfilled, he's gone.I think we tend to fixate on the insanely iconic romance scenes and the sinking of the ship. But a big focus of the actual movie is on the theme of finding the will to live. From Roses perspective, it's as if Jack conveniently springs into existence precisely when she needs him to stop her from ending her life and reveal to her a better way out of her misery. The moment that Jack dies is also the moment when Rose finally commits wholeheartedly to not dying. Jack teaches Rose to keep the fire going within her to rekindle in her the desire to live.Before the Titanic hits the iceberg, money, expressed as the classes onboard, seems all-important, especially to the people in first class. But when we're facing down death, all the riches in the world are suddenly revelled to be worthless. The move illustrates this perfectly when Cal tries to bride First officer Murdoch for a seat on the lifeboat. But Murdoch is about to die; so what use is money to him? Therefore if your ship is going down what does it matter what class you're going to die in? Near the end of the movie, we're told Cal commits suicide after losing much of his money in the Crash of 29. So because Cal cant understand that money really isn't everything, it's as if he never actually learns what the value of life is. When the older rose throws the heart of the ocean into the water at the end, she's again rejecting Cal's value system and the idea that wealth matters anywhere near as much as those inner, spiritual things that drive us. So Rose is giving the heart of the ocean back to Jack and recognizing the way that he resorted her heart to her - helping her find the fire within that she needed to live this long, full life.Rose appears at the start to be the ""damsel in distress' type. But it quickly becomes clear that Rose is our real hero - she's the one who undergoes a complete transformation, and this is her story. Jack exists to service Rose's story. Jack purpose in Titanic is to enable Rose's character growth. Jack has given her all the tools necessary for her survival, so his role in the story is complete. And that, essentially is why he has to die at the end. Not because he can't fit on the door but because the story has no more use for him. In the later story, the crew searching for the diamond tell us they didn't find anything on Jack and there's no record of him. The story gives us an excuse for this - Jack won his ticket last minute in a poker game. But it seems intentional that the movie plants the tiniest seed of doubt as to whether Jack was really on the ship after all. At the end of Rose's life. Jacks memory is completely erased from the world, except for the indelible impact he's left on her - so he's alive only in her heart. It's a bit of a stretch to read Titanic as Rose's romance with a guy who's totally imaginary - of course, many others interact with Jack. But the point is that jack has a subtle air of unreality about him... he feels like some fantasy of a sexy life-coach that every girl needs from time to time to help her reorient her heart in the right direction.Jack is the piece of her that's missing. A woman getting in touch with her animus (Masculine Side) often involves finding strength of will and determination to act. These are things that historically, society hasn't really encouraged in women (espeically in 1912). But as soon as Rose merges with Jack, her animus, she becomes daring and holds, her own woman. In an incredibly accelerated timeline, she ditches her fiance and turns her back on her family and social class. Rose shows sexual agency, too, actively pursuing Jack in their romance. And after she has sex with Jack, Rose is assertive, holding and comforting him. When she arrives on the other shore, she assumes a new name in a new country. Taking his last name is a symbolic commitment to Jack, representing the idea that in her secret mind, she is forever married to him. But if we say that he's her animus her ""marriage' to this piece of herself would symbolize a promise that she'll never abandon her own agency and will again. Jacks death can be read as the moment when her animus ceases to be something sperate from her - and the result is Rose Dawson.So as much as our culture remembers Titanic for the romance, fittingly the deepest theme of this movie about so many tragic deaths is finding the will to live. In order for Rose to recapture her will to live, she needs to honestly face what's wrong in her life and cut that out. Committing to being alive means committing to living authentically as oneself.Great movie that sill holds up all these years. RIP James Horner & Bill Paxton",10
396,"I am breathless and out of words for THIS film. No, its not the best film I've seen, but it certainly comes close to being. James Cameron is a true genius and he's the person to thank.Titanic is a wholesome tragedy adapted from the historic event when more 1000 people lost their lives. This film is pure art and will never be forgotten. It is filled with extravaganza effects, worthy performances, and a simply adorable soundtrack.Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances in his career. He is simply perfect as Jack; simple, yet humanized. Kate Winslet is even better, playing Rose with Gratitude, courage, and efficiency. This is also, simply her best performance in her career.Effects are simply breathtaking. James Cameron provides with stuff that you would have never seen in the 90s. As for his direction, also benefits because of his stretchy camera angles and glorious sights. This is seriously Cameron at his BEST and there's nothing more wonderful than that.Small things like soundtracks don't usually matter in films, but this film has the best I have heard in my life! Racy, touching, and emotional; there isn't anything like it.Overall, I have no words for Titanic. Almost everything is near-perfect in this timeless classic. It is also an unforgettable cinematic experience; as well as a benchmark in history for visual effects. James Cameron has got the big job done and has succeeded thoroughly.'Go see it now, because you certainly won't be disappointed one bit with this film'",10
397,"Titanic was a massive success upon release and still continues to be immensely popular. It is easy to see why: Jim Cameron is a master filmmaker and the set for the film- the ship itself is so awe inspiring you'd be fooled into thinking this was the real ship. The film is incredibly well paced- despite being quite long and the casting is top notch. Titanic made stars out of Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio and they are quite good here. One can see why Leo became a heartthrob after this film came out- he is very good. Jim Cameron has a passion for the Ocean and he seems right at home directing Titanic. Its funny to think that Titanic's box office record was eventually broken by his own Avatar, which is a testament to his talent as a storyteller and filmmaker.",9
398,"James Francis Cameron's Titanic is a well done film, but I think it gets more credit than it deserves.  True, the film won eleven Academy awards (including 3 for Cameron and 2 for composer James Horner), but I think it shouldn't had been ranked so high- like with Ben-Hur status.If you don't know the story of Titanic now, your probably one of the ones who didn't survive because the story is world-renoun.  So are it's actors (Leonardo DiCaprio is not at his best, Kate Winslet is at least hot, and Billy Zane works as a villain) who work into Jim Cameron's script about romance on the high seas.  Luckily, the film doesn't go as slow as you may think, but still, that's no excuse to have the Titanic sinking in the movie longer than it did in  real life.But seriously, this film does have many great qualitites.  The story is well lay out, and the special effects are dazzling (it actually looks like the Titanic is sinking) which also won a Oscar.  One of the great points in this film is the score by James Horner which is his best and one of the best ever, but that is over-shadowed by fancy fireworks and bad acting.  Good direction though.

399,"James Cameron went above-and-behind to write, direct, and produce the hugely popular box office film, Titanic. I've seen the move and read the script well over one hundred times.",10
400,"Best version since the old ""A Night to Remember"" (1953). With all those reviews, I only need to ""touch"" on the synopsis of the film. 101 year-old ""Rose"", long thought to have died in the disaster, reappears as the wreck is examined and it's contents rescued yet again. The ""explorer-scavenger"" is fascinated both with the story and romance of it all, but especially the recovery of the romantic 58 Caret heart-shaped diamond necklace known as ""The Heart of the Sea"" which is worth more than the Hope Diamond. Did such a gem exist, or is it the product of the screenwriter's vivid imagination? It is a well-told tale and the time passes so fast that it doesn't seem like a 3 hour movie at all. Superb cinematography combined with seamlessly beautiful special effects and the best shipwreck ever filmed. Models and the CGI are most convincing. The Oscar-winning musical score and audio are amazing. The ships motors and interior looks entirely authentic. Kathy Bates has a wonderful ""minor"" role as the ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown, and, as MGM used to say, ""a cast of ""more stars than there are in Heaven"". Billy Zane plays the deliciously mean and arrogant fiancée of 17-year-old ""Rose"",who is being forced to have pre-nupual sex, and marry a man she does not love, for his money. She hates it and is almost driven to suicide. One nude scene of a beautiful woman-child will offend only a minority of the viewing audience. (Rated PG-13. Also a few choice swear words.) Best ending ever (warning-huge spoiler) as ""Rose"" slips the huge blue diamond into the sea. The original DVD is letterboxed and not ""anamorphic"". Buy a later version, which is remastered for 16x9 TV. It is remastered to 1.78 format. I like to stop it around chapter 18 for an ""intermission"". I also highly recommend seeing ""Titanic-The Artifact Exhibit"" as a roadshow or Las Vegas attraction.",10
401,"This is probably the best example of a critic's grudge against a terrific film. Yes, the love story is clichéd and unoriginal. So what? Everything else is flawless. The effort James Cameron spent with the historical accuracy is commendable at least. Not so many times we can see a film set in a certain time period with appropriate costumes, set designs, silverware, etc. Even the actors were cast to be almost identical to their real life counterparts. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the dialog bad at all. There are no lines passing for catch phrases, like in other big budget movies. The visual effects, I'm speechless just to think about them. Even the love story, cheesy as it is, was greatly written, like in the old days. The acting was great, almost obliged to be great. The characters were amazingly portrayed, and Cameron made sure every single death would ache your heart (except for Lovejoy), something nobody really can do nowadays. Of course, there is the nude scene with Kate Winslet, something for all those pre-teens out there, and the little sex scene inside the coach. Aside of building up the romance between Rose and Jack, both scenes prove to be a little pointless. Even though, James Cameron is who actually draws the Rose picture, so that really gives more of an artistic merit. Music, well, it's good, and I don't mean just that song you all know. James Horner's score is actually very good, part of his list of great works.One critic spotted several technical errors in the movie, one of them being the sun's position during the ""I'm flying!"" sequence at the wrong side. But hey! If you want to find the bad stuff, you'll find it. That's not what film-making is about. You don't go to the theater to shred to pieces any single movie you see (we got MST3K for that). Titanic is one of those few movies that is timeless to this day. I can only compare it to Casablanca, or more specially to Gone With the Wind. It's larger than life, it's long as hell, but it's enjoyable every single time you see it (I forgot how many times I've seen it on TV alone).",9
402,"Released around the Christmas season of 1997,this was an epic scale of a motion picture event. Director James Cameron's three hour mega-budget picture has its brushes with disaster with a mammoth budget(which at the time this picture was made,it took two years to make and was the most expensive movie ever made at $285 million,the most costliest movie to date)and a theatrical release that seemed unattainable. But instead of reaping hordes of criticism for what many have thought was one of the biggest joke in Hollywood,Cameron received accumlated praise and a boatload of Oscar hardware for his labor of love,which rack up the Academy Awards with 11 Oscars including Best Picture,and has tied the record with ""Ben Hur"",and most recently the Lord Of The Rings final installment to the trilogy,""The Return Of The King"",as the most record number of Oscars to be presented in Hollywood.This was indeed,""Gone With The Wind"" on an epic scale.This was in fact a grand love story that happens to have the sinking of an historic ship as a backdrop,real characters and fictional characters are blended for a detailed re-enactment of the luxury liner's first and last voyage. The main characters,two lovebirds Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCaprio),and debutante Rose Bukater(Kate Winslet)are from different ends of the economic and social ladder. DiCaprio and Winslet are dynamic as the star-crossed lovers and make the running time of 198 minutes less a chore to sit through. The special effects are impressive with a life sized version of the ship just built for the film. Cameron's prowess as a storyteller keeps the outcome of the ship suspenseful and tense even though the ending is no secret. The film contains an all-star cast including Billy Zane,Bill Paxton,Kathy Bates,Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart(in her final film role),Jonathan Hyde-White,Danny Nicci, Bernard Hill,Victor Garber,Bernard Fox,Suzy Amis,and David Warner.The film has won numerous awards since its release and in 1997,it was the first film to win both the MTV Awards,Golden Globes and Oscars in that same year,not to mention Best Musical Score from composer James Horner and Best Song of that year,""My Heart Will Go On"" sung by Celine Dion. Also to point,during its release,""Titanic"" went on to break box office records,and it did just that but dethroning the all-time box office champ,""Star Wars"",not to mention other box-office records as well including ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"",""ET"",and others at the time of its release,since then that record has been shattered by the most recent ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy and the ""Harry Potter"" series.Released by two major Hollywood studios,Paramount Pictures and Twentieth Century-Fox,the film itself has become one of the spectacular Hollywood greats. A grand classic.MPAA Rating:""PG-13""-For Brief Nudity,Action/Adventure Situations including Peril,Violence,and Brief Language.",
403,"I was just wandering the city one day, seeing the city lights, so I went to see it. Titanic. The big movie, that everybody went and talked about.I'll go straight to the point and won't go as to say anything about the plot. We've all gotten that in by force I think. What I find good about this movie are the small things. Not where everything is focused upon: Decaprio and Kate obviously. The movie has much personality, so love it or hate it; you'll find something about Titanic that feels personal. I won't let out what I think was my favorite part of the movie.Titanic is, yes, a good movie. I would be blind if I didn't see the beauty of this movie. But, maybe Titanic is too much larger then life. When watching it, you fail to remember reality. It all seems all too Hollywood, with Decaprio's face on the dollar bill with Titanic in the background.Titanic tells us about every living thing on the ship (or so it seems) even the rats get a little spotlight in. But the whole thing seems still to evolve just two characters. So, it seems to me that the movie gets too shallow: Sinking a ship just to get a good love story? Ah well, maybe I'm too picky? Titanic is good though. Guess where my favorite part of the movie is? You'll never guess it. I'll give you a clue. Somewhere along the sinking scene. :) Enjoy the movie.",
404,"But NOT because the movie is an oh, so tragic story about two young lovers and a boat sinking in the sea. But because of one person - ONE PERSON ONLY - spent about a billion dollars on this movie (while about a billion human beings can't get food for the day, a house to sleep in or clean clothes) and didn't succeed to make a great movie. Three hours is how long this was. That's at least about two and a half hour too much. One thing if it they spent the money on a documentary on the subject, or at least spent the money on better boats, but not on this awful movie. The silly plot, ridiculous jokes, bad actors, an unoriginal subject ... What more can I say? O yeah - it has great special effects! ""But that's at least something!"" you might say! NO - IT'S - NOT! It's just another problem. Because special effects are not all, and if they had to spend money on special effects, they could at least have made a greater movie. I hope the producers and the director will spend the rest of eternity in hell, watching this movie. Over and over again.",1
405,"Titanic, being the most expensive, most publicized, and highest grossing film of all time (at least as of 2003, who knows what the future holds) is one of those films that can either be loved by soft-hearted individuals who love a good story or a well-made piece of cinema, or hated by movie buffs who consider it 'over-rated'. Personally I think it's a little of both.Essentially the real winner of the film is obviously the cinematography and the visual effects; the sinking of the ship is truly a masterpiece of realism and is a shocking perspective on what the sinking of the actual ship might have been like.But aside from the technical side, the film is nothing more than a simple love story, and it is actually quite badly portrayed; the terribly over played comments on class structure and the neverending possibilities of love clash extremely sharply with the very under played relationship between Jack and Rose; there is never a spark between them, and it seems such a short period of time between Jack talking Rose out of killing herself and the two suddenly copulating in the back of somebody else's car in the hold of the ship. It's almost as if James Cameron couldn't decide which elements of the film to over-dwell on and which to just touch upon, because the development of the relationship is one that he could easily have stressed more definitely.The performances as well leave something to be desired. While I have been a long-serving advocate against the talents of Leonardo DiCaprio, this movie is in my opinion, easily his worst. He lacks all the elements that make up a classic film character; charisma, empathy and credibility. As so often ruins a good performance, throughout the entire movie, he is making such an obvious effort to act and it is so apparent visually that the character is lost, and apart from that, it is not a difficult role to play. On the other hand, Kate Winslet is better although not brilliant; she does have charisma and empathy and we can enjoy the character of Rose a lot better. The minor characters are another good element of the film. They don't sparkle but they fill in the story nicely, as minor characters are supposed to do. Jonathan Hyde is excellent as the ship's designer, I felt truly sorry for him when the news is finally broken to him that the Titanic is not, as previously thought, unsinkable.Overall, Titanic is a behemoth of film-making, but that is not quite enough to make it a true classic. It seems too cute, too much like a daytime soap opera to make it a milestone of cinema. Titanic is impressive, nothing more. And while I quite enjoyed watching it, it can never be more than a three star film for me.",
406,"This is one of the most overrated movies of all time. I didn't find a single reason to love it.It's long, boring and ends in a pathetic way. Those who say the ship- wrecking scene is great in terms of visuals need to watch 2001: A Space Odyssey which has much better visuals than this movie and was made in 1968 (its a sci-fi about space).This is a complete waste of time. It's way too long. It's so boring. It's a bad love story. There are no great visuals as people say. The fanboys are worst. Cameron is a great director but sorry this movie sucks. I wasted my 3 hours on this piece of garbage.",2
407,"It takes me back to my childhood, as i am 1992 bornmy most favorite movie till date (2020)",10
408,"Before Titanic, I wasn't really a Cameron-fan. I liked his movies but I never thought of him as a genius (It was only later that I saw his brilliant remake of the French comedy La Totale! – True Lies, that is – which might have made me appreciate his talents more.) To tell the truth, I wasn't really interested in another adaptation of the tragedy of the Titanic, either. The movie was over-hyped and overpriced, so I thought I'd give it a pass, but I finally gave in to peer pressure. I left the theatre raving about the movie myself.It has remained one of my all-time favourites to this day. Titanic is a true masterpiece that combines a great real-life story with an equally heartbreaking imaginary one and has such visual grandeur and emotional depth that very few movies have managed to bring to the screen. It deserved every single Oscar it was given (save for the score, which is, frankly, a shameless and unimaginative rip-off of Enya's music) and it should have been awarded more. It is a shame that Kate Winslet's, Leonardo DiCaprio's and Gloria Stuart's stunning performances were shunned.It is very sad that since then it has become fashionable to dismiss the movie as a 'corny, boring melodrama', because it is anything but. Titanic is an impeccably written and directed, wonderfully acted and (from a technical point of view) superbly realised, timeless masterpiece. And it has one of the most beautiful lines ever written for the screen. 'A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets'.",10
409,"I watched this film in 1997 or 1998 I don't remember and after watching I wanted those hours of my life watching this film back.I mean, the had the right idea to make a film about the Titanic, but for god's sakes to make it film about two people who fall in love on the Titantic was just plain bad. The movie is not very accurate, and their are a lot of historical mistakes, which really bog down the movie. The only reason I can find for watching this film is to see Kate Winslet, who is very pretty.I was upset they made a love type story based around a disaster. If you want to watch this movie, due it with all due caution as you may find yourself hitting your head on wall after watching it.",3
410,"Is it one of my favorite movies? No. Is it one of the greatest movies Hollywood ever made? Yes. Titanic is objectively one of the greatest movies of all time, and it's undeniable.What works against it are the incredibly long runtime of over 3 hours, which can dredge along on rewatches at the beginning, and the fact that it's a Romance movie, which will likely turn off many male viewers who prefer action, thrillers, and some dramas. So while it's among the best movies of all time, it does have drawbacks for certain audiences.Titanic excels best in the third and final act, the last hour or so, when they strike the iceberg and just before that as the romance heats up more. There it evolves into an action-packed, heart racing thriller with lots of moving parts. Beyond the unforgettable and realistic spectacle of the sinking ship (which amazingly makes you feel like you are right there), there is still plenty of story left to be told, and no matter how strong you think you are, this movie will pull at even the most stoic person's heartstrings, quite a tearjerker for most people.It's a true epic. Director Cameron's ambition (the most expensive movie ever made at the time over 200 million in 1997) and commitment to consistency and quality being quite the ""movie"" experience, Kate Winslet's unforgettable lead performance as Rose (how did she not win the Oscar?; she should have), and the emotional components set in front of the background of one of the most infamous disasters of the 20th century, all factor into making Titanic one of the most groundbreaking and iconic love story movies of all-time.9/10.",9
411,"When you first hear about Titanic you immediately think you know whats going to happen (if haven't seen the movie yet you will) you'll think a sinking ship, a quick romance blooms, and a tragic story, well your right. But something about this is different from what you would usually see in a movie with this story.Just about everything in this movie is beautiful including the story, the music, even the tragic ending. When I first heard of Titanic I didn't really care for it at the time. When I was wondering how could this be the first movie to reach a billion dollars and stay the highest grossing movie of all time I decided to watch it and see why other people love it so much. And now I'm one of those people. For those of you that haven't seen Titanic it is a must-see film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet make the perfect on screen couple in Titanic.This is a movie about two different class people that fall in love with each other and they are shunned for it. Rose (Kate Winslet) is a upper class woman being forced to marry a man she doesn't love while Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a poor artist who makes a break getting to go to America again on Titanic. Simple really what happens next he saves her life they fall in love and something tragic happens the end. But how it comes about is really amazing the special effects and the script make such a simple story amazing.This is probably one of the most amazing, beautiful, and purely spectacular films of the 1990's. A must-see for all movie goers.",10

413,"My Take: An indisputably sweeping epic. A future classic? It should be.(This is an extension of the review I wrote in February 2007)Every so often, a magnificent epic would just take you away from all that and just sweep you by your feet. James Cameron's unbeatable, $200 million TITANIC is exactly that film, so it just upsets me why some people still don't get it.I was just wondering, it compelled me more than any other film I've seen for quite awhile (not to mention, it won 11 awards in the Oscars and scored high in the box-office), but why some people try to act cynical and bash this wonderful motion picture (This film is rated 7/10 here on IMDb? Come on!). ""Titanic"" is really that rare kind of masterpiece we don't usually find in today's film era. It wasn't just a big-budgeted film, it was a truly dramatic and touching tale with an old-fashioned romance that movies like CASABLANCA revolutionized. If movies like that are classics in a way TITANIC wanted to revisit, then may I ask what's wrong? The cast, headed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, are superb. The direction and writing job by James Cameron is terrific (So is he just getting a hang of the love story thing? I think not!). But one of the real highlights is the superb score by James Horner, and the magnificent theme song. It has become one of my favorite all-time songs. The film too, has become one of my all-time favorites. Not only that, the film is also accurate on some of the facts. James Cameron really made sure to make it as realistic as possible. Like the sinking of the Titanic. Cameron really made that realistic (about the ship splitting in half before sinking). Anyway, combining such elements make it such a winner that won't insult you.I'm sure the movie is not without its imperfections, but when a movie's too good to be true, such elements don't come to you. It never did throughout the immense but utterly sweeping 194 minutes. It's entertainment at its best.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10
414,"'Titanic' looked so promising, but personally I would say it is the worst film ever made.  Not only does it lay aside any consideration of real stories that happened on the ship, but it constructs a piece of ridiculous class-divide mush instead!Leonardo di Caprio (excellent in Romeo + Juliet) and Kate Winslet fail to convince as Jack and Rose, a boy from steerage and a girl from first class. And Billy Zane was downright embarrassing as Rose's stuck-up fiance.  There were some good performances - Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, Bernard Hill as Captain Smith, even Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose - but they are few and far between.The biggest problem I had with the film though was the god-awful script and scenes.  Corny lines ('as we walk through the valley of death'/'could you walk a little faster?').  The scene in the car where the windows mist up just at the crucial moment.  The ridiculous pose at the head of the ship. And perhaps worst of all, the clean water and the fact that Winslet keeps travelling in the lift - downwards - as the ship floods.Watching 'Titanic' for me was a total waste of over 3 hours and an excruciating experience.  May I never have the misfortune to see even a minute of it again.",2
415,"As an epic, it doesn't change, even a little, my perception of life. As a love story, I've seen better. However, I have to say - technically - and as entertainment - Titanic is great. The special effects, the replica of the ship, and all other technical details are a feast for the eyes. And it certainly entertains, as it never lapses to boredom and although it's over 3 hours long, it doesn't really register.Anyway, I'd say it is quite worth the watch. Just don't expect it to change your life.",7
416,"Once in every decade since the inception of the motion picture camera, comes a film that seems to transcend criticism and stands the test of time as one of the all time greats. Such is the case with James Cameron's magnum opus, Titanic. This epic recreation of the ocean liner's ill-fated maiden voyage offers everything one can ask for, and more. There is spectacle and dramatic images that sticks with viewers for a very long time.The film begins as a frame story, with a 101 year old survivor, Rose (played by Gloria Stuart), telling a team of treasure hunters and scientists her experience on the Titanic. As a younger woman (now played by Kate Winslet) Rose traveled in first class on the Titanic with her materialistic mother and her haughty fiancée Cal (played by Billy Zane) Rose feels completely suffocated by the stiff and mind numbing activities and chatter that comes with being rich, and wants to break out and just do something exciting. Her life changes when she meets third-class artist Jack Dawson (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) As the two talk and hang out more and more, they begin to fall for one another. Of course, her mother and fiancée disapprove mainly because he is poor. Everything comes to head when the ship hits an iceberg and begins to sink to her inevitable doom. Some people have made the joke to death that this film is essentially ""Romeo and Juliet on the Titanic."" I see this as only somewhat true, as there are indeed similar elements, but the real story would detract from a by-the-numbers correlation between the stories. Here the love story really works on many levels. Rose and Jack do not fall in love at first sight. When they start talking with one another, they see that they do have much in common. It takes a few days but they decide that they are best for each other and fall completely in love.Cameron has done something very special with all the characters characters in this film. He has always been noted for putting characters and interactions above the story, and so he does here too. Jack, Rose, Cal, Ruth, and Lovejoy are all fictional characters of course, but they all interact very convincingly with the real-life characters. In this way, when the ship sinks, the audience has built up and emotional connection to both fictional and real characters, allowing for more heartbreaking truth when most of the characters die or are in peril when the ship is sinking.The casting of this movie is phenomenal. I have to credit casting director Mali Finn and Cameron for really finding great actors, and some of the best character actors in the business. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet forever made a splash (no pun intended) as two of Hollywood's best leading actors, and have so far proved that they are two of the best.When production began on this film, Cameron knew partial sets and models simply wouldn't do. So he and his crew went out and actually built a huge version of the ship, carpets and all. He is a perfectionist, therefore everything on the ship had to be artistically and physically correct, to lend a greater sense of verisimilitude when the audience viewed it in 1997. It looks simply breathtaking, and we feel like we have been transported to the actual ship itself. As far as we know, Cameron probably knows the Titanic than anyone, so when its shown here in its glory, we believe it. Of course, Titanic is about the sinking of the ""unsinkable"" ship. The final hour of the film is indeed the most gripping, as we see the ship start slipping beneath the waves. Cameron uses his extensive knowledge of special effects to very convincingly present the sinking in all of its gruesome truth. Its very well paced, finely edited, and of course, spectacular. And what makes it even more moving is we have gotten to know the characters and therefore its very heartbreaking when most of them die. The aftermath is of course, very tragic and cruel, because we all know what happened. But when it came on screen, we were still broken by it. When those who couldn't get into the lifeboat drown, we wish in our hearts that they could have. There is more her that will shock viewers, but I wouldn't dream in a million years of revealing the ending of Jack and Rose's story arc.Just as I claimed for Steven Spielberg directing Schindler's List, here, it initially seems like James Cameron is the wrong man for the job at first glance. He is known for action films, no romances or dramas. Yet somehow, this is the greatest film he has ever done. He directs with a keen vision, and is quite unrelenting in getting his vision across, hence why many people despise working with him. But his passion and dedication to the project shines through all the way through its three hour running time. Such dedication won the film multiple Oscars (11 to be precise) Cameron himself took home 4 in one night, cementing his status as one of the most successful filmmakers of our generation.This is one of the best films to grace the cinema. The sheer might and size of the picture doesn't dwarf the actors, who are given the chance to breath and connect us to one of the most infamous tragedies in history. A sharp criticism of man's hubris, and a stirring tribute to those who lost their lives that night. Such is how I can describe Titanic.",10
417,"Let me start off by saying that there really can't be any spoilers about this movie, as anyone who knows anything about history already knows how this film will end. The Titanic is going to sink! What a surprise! There are three major reasons why I don't like this movie.Reason 1: We know how the film is going to end before we even see it. The ship is going to sink. If filmmakers want to make a movie in which the audience already knows what is going to happen, they need to do a better job than to simply turn it into a sappy love story. Which brings me to the second reason.Reason 2: This is another historical event turned into a sappy love story, blended in which a whole lot of Hollywood inaccuracy. The acting is terrible, and the characters are very uninteresting.Reason 3: Time. This movie is more than three hours long! Is that really necessary? No it isn't. It is a three hours of my life that I could have used way more productively. It is a three hours of my life, gone forever! Wasted! And I can never get it back! I was thankful when DiCaprio died, because I knew the movie was almost over. I can't believe this movie got so much praise. Its right there in the same league as ""Pearl Harbor"". Pure, un-adulterated junk. I gave it a 3/10, only because they did a pretty nice job ""reviving"" the ship itself. Don't watch it. If you take my advice, you have just saved three hours of your life.",3
418,"I watched this movie tonight in the Blu-ray 3-D version! I thought it was a wonderful movie! I have seen the original version at the theater and have watched it several times on TV. I think it is one of the most heart wrenching movies I have ever seen. I loved the music, the actors, and the story-line. The 3-D version is the BEST in my opinion.I ordered the 3-D version from AMAZON several weeks ago and waited impatiently for it in the mail. When it arrived today I could hardly wait to watch it on my 3-D TV!I thought Kate Winslet, Leonard DiCaprio and others did an amazing job.I looked at the era this was set in and thought about my own Dad who would have been in his mid-20's at that time and how a catastrophe like the sinking of a ship like the Titanic might have affected the people of that era.Great movie!",10
419,"I guess people love romance and melodrama. I found that this movie would only appeal to pre-pubescent girls with a storybook notion of romance and lovey-dovey mush. This movie is one of the most highly overrated in movie history, if only because it is the most successful film ever made, and the critics seem to sing with the choir of the global audience that paid over $1 billion to watch it. The love story is, as I said, pure mush, with a cardboard (yet effeminate) villain, played by Billy Zane. The story itself is a flimsy framework to show off the grand effect of the giant ship snapping to pieces and drowning doomed computer-animated passengers. The Celine Dion song for this is atrocious (it polluted the airwaves for much of 1997), and is just as sickening as this film. The characters are bland and uncompelling, the story slow and plodding, and the special effects are the only reason to enjoy this movie.This movie belongs with the likes of any of those mushy 1980s romance or romantic comedy sort of films. For those who like melodrama, you may like ""Titanic."" Most guys will want to pass on this film, unless your girlfriends force you to watch against your own will. I personally found the story of the Mexican props crew who built the pseudo-Titanic to be far, FAR, FAR more compelling than the sappy love story between Jack and Rose.",5
420,"This is EXACTLY what I think: It annoys me when people say they don't like this movie. Yes, it might not be a masterpiece but this was a damn good cinematic achievement. Ben-Hur has a higher rating than this and it's about a man and his encounter with Jesus. If they have an epic with Jesus mentioned that is IN the IMDb top 250, then they should have this movie in the Top 250. This was a very realistic movie. Yes, James Cameron might have stretched some issues but they are very plausible.I always tear up when the music gets intense (anyone who has seen this, will know what I mean) or when I hear the Academy Award winning song that was in this movie (My Heart Will Go On) I tear up. This is the ONLY movie that has made me cry. I don't think I'll find another epic like this that'll make me cry.I've watched about 3/4 of all the movies in the Top 250 and at the very least HALF of them are unworthy of the place they are in. Hell, about a third of what I watched ought not to be on this list but maybe 150 places above the Bottom 100 and that's me being nice.People just have to watch this movie with ABSOLUTELY NO BIASED OPINION or preconceived notion that they heard it was bad. That's how I came to love it. It's now my favorite movie of all time.The effects are the best I've seen since the epics of the 50s. The acting was brilliant and Gloria Stuart should have won Best Supporting Actress for Old Rose. Hell, Kathy Bates should have grabbed a nomination at least. Not a win, but just a nomination. Maybe Victor Garber should have gotten a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The same with Jonathan Hyde. That's how believable I think this was. The second movie to win 11 Oscars in cinematic history and THE highest grossing movie of all time. This ought to be right up there in the ratings with Ben-Hur.People have to think twice about the rating they gave it and give it a higher rating. That's my opinion. I don't care what anybody thinks about it, it is just out there. Like it or hate it, think twice on this movie before giving it a low rating.15/10! That's what I believe.",10
421,"Ok, who hasn't seen this film? Since I just saw it tonight, I am unquestionably the last or next to last person to see it. Just on the chance that the last person to see it is reading this, then here goes.There are very few things to quibble about in this movie. The sets are phenomenal. The ship is magnificent. How they could create such a marvel is beyond me. The story is the key, however. It really is a relatively simple boy meets girl, falls in love, saves her life, gives his sort of a tale. A Romeo and Juliet on water.The performers are engaging, but I wouldn't go so far as to say the acting was spectacular. DiCaprio was very good, but otherwise the acting was adequate. The story was extremely good and fit in well to the historical event.I only wouldn't give this movie a 10 because it was a little depressing in the end and it was also a period piece - not my favorite genre. But otherwise it was truly a magnificent achievement.",9
422,"I avoided watching this movie for years and years, despite the entreaties of friends who insisted I would love it. Finally, many years after this was released, I capitulated and watched it with a friend. It was as bad as I had suspected. Overrated, predictable, overly sentimental and dull. I can't work out why so many people love it. It's a Hallmark movie on steroids.",4
423,"Jame's Cameron's ""Titanic"" struck a chord with movie goers of all ages for one simple reason : it moved. As corny and implausible as the screenplay is, Cameron nevertheless seamlessly weaved historical fact with soap opera fiction to create a movie that hearkened back to Hollywood's Golden Age. Is ""Titanic"" the equal of ""Gone With The Wind""? Not by several knots. But it is a monumental production by any standards and in 1997 was the most sensational thing to come down the pike since the glory days of David O. Selznick  and David Lean. ""Titanic"" is a grand, immensely entertaining extravaganza.",
424,"Pros:
1) the theme of the story
2) the rush in the second half
3) touching scenes
4) good acting
Cons:
1) predictable scriptOverall pros wins over cons so its definitely a 9/10.",10
425,"So far, this is the most heavily user-reviewed movie I have encountered in IMDb. Here is yet another one (sorry)! During the summer of 1997, the studios ran grand coming attractions for ""Titanic,"" which capsulized the entire story and even showed in detail what would happen to Jack and Rose. It was tempting to think ""...why even see the movie? You already know what is going to happen!"" The movie absolutely cleaned up during the holiday season of 1997 and into the first few months of 1998. The theatrical experience of watching it on a big screen with stereo sound was beyond compare (my sister swears that the cinema in Cincinnati where she saw it cranked the air conditioning during the sinking scenes to give viewers an extra dimension to the frigid cold endured by all the passengers).On the surface, the plot lines and basic story seem trite and contrived (poor boy meets rich girl). The fantastic acting by the leads and the direction of the massive cast of extras along with the superhuman attention to detail are what makes Titanic jump from the screen at the viewer.Think about the whole ""king of the world"" sequence with Jack and Fabrizio and the ""flying"" sequence with Jack and Rose. In the hands of a lesser director, both of these would have come across as self-aggrandizing pap, but the way both scenes is shot and Leo DeCaprio/Kate Winslet's uncanny abilities and chemistry sent a shot of ecstasy throughout the whole theater. These scenes, along with several others, works well to capture the fabulous grandeur of the original Titanic.What is most often missed in reviews are the performances of actors in lesser roles, such as Billy Zane's turn as an elegant cad, David Warner's perfect casting as the classy ""thug"" bodyguard, Kathy Bates nailing her gauche, nouveau riche embodiment of the ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown (she was a last minute casting), and scores of other astounding recreations from the captain to the top hatted billionaire and his eyes popping out when the water floods the stateroom.According to the trivia page, cinemas wore out their copies and needed replacements. People have probably also worn out their VHS, DVD and blue-ray copies. Nothing will wear out the enduring appeal of this classic as pure, full-on entertainment.",10
426,"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*""Titanic"" is clearly one of the best films ever made.  I first saw it in theaters when it came out back when I was 10 years old( Actually I saw it twice in theaters since it was that good).  Now I am 17 and I still love this movie and never get tired of it. ""Titanic"" told the story of a poor man named Jack, who won tickets for the ship about an hour before it sailed, falling in love with a very rich first class woman named Rose. Together they experience many adventures on the ship, including the sinking of the ship.I believe this is one of the best films ever made.  The acting is good, the special effects are great, the music is beautiful (I love the song ""My Heart Will Go On""), and the plot is wonderful.  I""m glad this movie won all of those Academy Awards because it really deserved them.  The only complaint I have about this movie is that it's a little to long even tho every second of it is enjoyable.  Other than that this movie is great and it deserves a full 10/10 stars.",10
427,"Special effects junkies may get something out of this film, but I found it long, very boring and totally unmoving.  The characters in general were shallow and one-dimensional;  none of the main characters were in the slightest bit likeable, and the film's potential was ruined by the extremely silly and totally fabricated central story of the ""upstairs/downstairs"" romance between Di Caprio and Winslett.  This totally implausible bit of the plot succeeds in turning this tale of a terrible human tragedy into just another trite Hollywoodisation in which only beautiful people and thwarted love count for much.  Such a shame - given the dreadful, tragic setting (which, let's face it, really did happen), it could have been a good film.......",2
428,"Trying to get beyond all the hype-- the ludicrous praise and the vehement reaction against-- I tried to rate this movie objectively, and and in doing so I gave it a three out of ten. It is not the worst movie ever made, and it's certainly not the best. Some nice special effects. Hackneyed two-dimensional characters and dialogue written for early teens, but not particularly offensive. Can be watched from start to finish once with only a dozen or so moments of cringing.However, what did sink right along with that ship was the prestige of the Oscar Award itself. Now the Oscars have given out silly ""Best Pictures"" in the past, and there has always been a creeping element of the Grammies' ""popularity contest"" about them that kept them from ever getting too ""high brow""; but with the choosing of ""Titanic"" as the Best Picture for 1997, I honestly believe that the Academy did serious damage to its reputation for many years to come. Previously, serious film lovers knew that while the Oscars certainly weren't a foolproof measure of quality; in retrospect, they have produced a list of the greatest films that, on the whole, stands the test of time just as well as any list created by the Cannes, Venice, Berlin or Toronto film festivals. But this year (1997) changed everything. Not only did they overlook one of the best films of the decade (""L.A. Confidential""), but they made an obvious bow to box office as a ratings ploy and lowest-common-denominator crowd pleaser. With time, the decision to crown an overgrown adolescent throwaway flick the best movie of the year will haunt them mercilessly-- if it doesn't already.",3
429,"I have grown quite sick of this movie and the Celiene Deon song.  If there wasn't some much said about it, I probably would have liked it more. Frankly, the dialogue and much of the plot was silly.  The way they told the story, by starting in the present, was quite interesting, and compared to other disaster films its outstanding, but best movie of all time? NO!",1
430,In Titanic (T3) James Cameron unwittingly remakes his first hit The Terminator. In both films a couple struggle to escape an unstoppable machine which is on a relentless course to destroy them. Only the girl survives but it is unknown whether Kate is pregnant with a child who will save all mankind. In this case I guess it means the iceberg is Skynet since it programs the Titanic on its mission to take them down.,8
431,"The story of 'Titanic' is so good that if written as mere fiction, it would be dismissed as preposterous.In April of 1912, Titanic set out on its maiden voyage to the City of New York. 'The Ship of Dreams' as it was called, was a floating palace for the wealthy elite, reportedly 'unsinkable' by incorporating the latest in shipbuilding technology. After winning a pair of third-class tickets for himself and a friend in a poker game, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) looks forward to returning to his native America but finds himself drawn to a first-class passenger named Rose (Kate Winslet). She is the 16-year-old fiancée of Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) - a high-society gentleman that doesn't like to lose - returning from her wedding in Europe; a match of convenience pushed by her mother to bolster the family's faded coffers. After Jack's chance meeting on the ship's fantail with Rose threatening to hurl herself into the ocean, an unlikely romance begins. No sooner do they profess their love to each other, than an iceberg in the North Atlantic tests the character of everyone on board, from the ship's captain to the poorest of the poor as it slowly iceberg rips the safe, stable deck out from beneath the characters.Titanic is an extraordinary motion picture – a jaw-dropping feat of outstanding art direction, costume design and cinematography. The film captures the essence and decadence of the era, as well as the spirit and raw allure of the ship herself. Coupled with nearly seamless visual effects, James Cameron's Titanic feels like a wholly real creation. Instead of treating the Titanic as a microcosm of society, Cameron makes the ship a vividly realized, fluid symbol of human destiny, mapping the different levels of the ship as levels of character, from the social graces of the salon to the sexual heat of the engine room. Created through a complex blend of partial sets, models and digital effects, Cameron's Titanic is breathtaking in its wholeness, heartbreaking in its destruction. The film's final hour portrays the sinking, not merely as spectacle, but as a series of harsh moral choices that must be made by all the characters as they decide who will live and who will die. But perhaps, the neatest thing about his filmmaking is the engaging way 'Titanic' sucks us into what seems, on the surface, to be a magnetic romance, while underneath, there are dangerous currents of class consciousness and shoals of hubris. Yes, he does paint his story in broad strokes, and some of the dialogue is risible, but Leo and Kate sell the hell out of it, with their undeniable chemistry.Titanic isn't just a great film, it's a magnificent historical record of one of the most unfortunate disasters in the annals of human history, that is both poignant and personal.",9
432,"I almost always refrain from posting negative reviews.  What I find ridiculous may be sublime to others.  However, this is one movie that I find so disgustingly revolting that I cannot resist adding my unwelcomed two-cents.If you're one of the three people on earth who hasn't seen the film, PLEASE take my advice and find something more constructive to do with your time.Director/writer James Cameron has reduced a TRULY horrific event into a ludicrously trite love story that makes Days of Our Lives seem like a Shakespearean tragedy by comparison.  Instead of focusing the story on actual people and events,  Cameron took the easy way out and created a cast of dull, sterotypical characters who spout inane dialogue seemingly lifted from a tv-movie-of-the-week.  Rampant historical inaccuracies, cliched directing, uninspired acting, and ridiculously cheap sentimentality all add up to one over-hyped, overrated spectacle.The only thing more nauseating than the film itself was James Cameron's ""moment of silence"" at the Oscars for the real victims of the disaster. The ""movie"" Titanic has about as much to do with the actual disaster as the Police Academy movies do with law enforcement.  This film isn't a testament to human tragedy...it's a disgusting marketing ploy aimed at bilking moviegoers out of money,  while making a mockery out of those people who experienced an event that no one should ever face.",1
433,I can´t see what so great with this film. For me it´s just a lot of noise and terrible f/x. Skip this one and see A Night to Remember!,1
434,"Wow, well what can I say that hasn't already been said. these are some of my favorite actors and they are in a tragic love story!! How amazing! Leo and Kate have chemistry that is so perfect and so sweet. In the movie they really feel like they are friends that grow into a loving relationship. The imagery is gorgeous and the story has such heart! It's still so terrible that this is a true event that has happened. I couldn't imagine being on the ship when all of this was happening. There are times that it was slow but other than that I will always love this movie. It will always be a favorite! Leo is such a great character in this movie and he is such a likable character and Kate is as well.",9
435,"I gave this film a bad review on IMDb in 2002. I deleted my review today - mainly because I don't agree with it anymore. In fact, I'm not so sure I totally agreed with it when I wrote it. I felt an obligation to hate this movie because people who like it are typically made fun of. But I have to admit: I _do_ like it. Yes, the romantic subplot is silly to the extent that Jack would never find himself anywhere near Rose to begin with. But you know what? The romance provides a nice outlet through which to frame the actions of the Titanic's sinking. A three-hour movie about random people on a boat that's going to sink would be a true bore. James Cameron - despite his personal flaws - is a great storyteller and by focusing on characters before heading on to the carnage, he builds a relationship with the viewer. Think of any good historical movie - apart from a few films such as ""The Longest Day,"" most of the time there's a story taking place around the event.As for ""Titanic"" - some people will feel offended. Some people will hate the romantic subplot and find the entire thing unbearably hokey. Some people will make fun of Leonardo DiCaprio (although, thankfully, that phase seems to have passed and he now demands more respect as an actor). And some people will just fast-forward to the end so they can see the Titanic sink (and I'm really hoping that wasn't a spoiler for anyone - because if it was, you need to go take a middle school history course again).The acting isn't bad. Leonardo DiCaprio picked up a lot of misery for his acting here. But he's gone on since to prove, like Johnny Depp, that he's more than just a pretty face. His performances in films such as ""The Aviator"" and ""Catch Me If You Can"" echo his early work in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" - he's one of this generation's finest actors. It's no wonder Scorsese enjoys working with him so much. It may almost seem absurd to even make this comparison, but after some of his recent films DiCaprio has struck me as another Robert De Niro: he has the talent and the intelligence. It's a shame the success of ""Titanic"" pushed him back for a few years.Kate Winslet, on the other hand, is a nice contrast against DiCaprio, however I didn't totally buy their romance at all times and they're not the best screen couple in cinema history by any means. Meanwhile, in the Villain Department, Billy Zane is, for once, not bald.If you don't think you'll like it, you probably won't. It's one of those films that people either love or hate. If you didn't like ""Braveheart"" there's a good chance you'll hate this as well.If you can watch it with an open mind, however, and accept its romantic angle, you may enjoy it.",8
436,"This is considered one of the best made films of all time. James Cameron outdoes himself big time, but this won't be the last epic he ever makes. The story of the Titanic like you've never seen it before. Epicness beyond anything reachable.The story is told in a flashback perspective, with Rose Dawson, a survivor of the Titanic, telling it to a group of scientists, and her granddaughter, telling about her experience on the Titanic, leading up to the fateful night where it would meet its historical doom. It also circles around her life changing star cross love affair with Jack Dawson, (Leonardo DiCaprio) another person on the Titanic.Begins with one of the greatest music scores of all time by James Horner, and then slowly takes us back to the very beginning. Goes incredibly smooth with the camera movement, making each and every individual scene epic as ever. The performances are beautiful as ever, with Billy Zane, Kate Winslet, Gloria Stuart, and Leo DiCaprio leading a brilliant cast.The first half is getting everything acquainted on the ship, and introducing all the characters, and setting the plot. The second half consists entirely of the boat sinking, which is very graphic. The visual effects are mind-blowing, with excellent and detailed parts of the ship. The music, editing, and setting really capture every single feeling and thought raced through the actual minds of the real people.One of three movies in history to win 11 Oscars. The others being Ben- Hur, and Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. I had to watch the movie five more times until I finally managed to without crying. Its a real tear fest. Almost everybody in this film is crying. Its depressing as ever, but in a good way. It brilliantly captures the terror of the people. Its hard for a film to do that. James Cameron wasn't screwing around when he made this. Everything in this movie is excellent. Nothing is in fault, absolutely nothing. Everything is 100% accurate!This film killed at the box office, which it well should have. Its a film that will go down in history. A film that nobody will ever forget, and will always cherish every little moment this film brings.",9

On April 15th 1912 at 2:20am Titanic was sunk. the movie was made in 1997, i think when in 2012 when it's the 100th anniversary, i think they should put Titanic back in the cinemas to mark the 100th anniversary of the titanic that sunk.",10
438,"i gave this film a 1, but thats only because there was no -999 rating, this film sucked, because there was absolutley no plot. how can you have a 3 hour movie with no plot. the story was a rip off of romeo and juliette, and even that was done badly. the only part of the film i liked was when, jack's friend is swimming away and that big massive chimney shaped thing drops on him,,, oh how i laughed.i remember when this movie came out,, and there was such hype about it, being the most expensive movie ever made, and everyone was going on about how amazing it is. that was 4 years ago. 4 years later titanic ends up in one of those Crazy Eddie bargain Video box's for £2.99,, and incase you don't know, thats where all the lame video's end up. the fact is Titanic is,, excuse me,, WAS all hype, behind the hype the film could not stand the test of time because it is a lame film.and for those of you who think 4 years is a long time for hype to last,, then think of Star Wars 24 years ago and STILL selling strong,, Seven Samurai 50 years later and is STILL inspiring new directors. Titanic,,, 4 years later Crazy Eddie Bargain Video Box £2.99",1
439,"We should be reviewing the hype, because it was more creative, more interesting and says more about our warped society than this turgid drama ever could.

Repulsive.",
440,"Mea Culpa: I had not watched the film till this week. But, I finally sat down and watched it over two nights. I know that Titanic aficionado's will be picking the movie apart for any mistakes and for me that's not important. I don't care enough about the ship and it's history to worry about such matters. I just enjoyed the drama for what it was, even if it was weaving quite a bit of the story out of thin air.The visual impact of the film is very powerful, with the sets giving the viewer the believable impact of watching the real thing, the original ship. The special effects were as good as I've ever seen. Again, the way the ship moved, looked like, flooded, broke apart, all those things looked very real to my eyes.The dramatic love affair is of course the hook that grabs you and it is hard not to be carried away into the sadness without your heart feeling like it has been hurt. It is a very sad story, even if it is made up (I don't know and don't care if it is). There is enough tragedy in the real story of so many people freezing to death in the frigid North Atlantic or drowning for one to feel sad. Just as a drama, I found it very entertaining and emotionally effective. Kate Winslett is gorgeous, sexy and wonderful to watch. I have noticed in almost all the films I've seen with her....that she fills up the screen with a great deal of light. Not only is she beautiful, she exudes youth and energy and in this film she is a delight to behold. Leonardo Di Caprio is wonderful and I have yet to see him in a film that I wasn't captivated. He is, like Johnny Depp, a delight to watch. This is a film with a large cast, especially the many stunt actors, who must have really suffered a lot of hours in cold water. It's a larger than life story and the film delivers. Well worth the 11 Oscars. Excellent and I'm really glad to have finally seen it. A keepsake. This is what blockbusters are supposed to be like.",10

Cuz that would probably really suck, so I hope they don't do a sequel about that.",1
442,"Titanic, which is currently the biggest film of all time, (Why? is the biggest question of them all!) definitely has divided moviegoers in the last decade since it's release. Many women feel it is one of their favorite films of all time with great special effects, and a lead that they can relate to. Most men on the other hand, obviously feel very differently than women do about this film.Many others, like myself, easily feel that James Cameron's Titanic is easily the most overrated film in history with bloated, cheesy and banal dialoge, two dull lead characters, and a storyline which cheapens the tragedy of the sunken ship.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet play the star crossed lovers aboard the doomed ship, while a supporting cast with Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, and Bernard Hill do their best in trying to keep the screenplay and Cameron's bloated dialoge from falling out of place.The visual effects, which looked decent at the time has not held up well, there is a lot of pixelation of the ship itself, and the crash sequence today looks like something out of a playstation video game.The dialoge also today does not hold up well, and many sequences such as Rose holding up a middle finger does not support believability in the least. Secondly, while the two leads are treading frozen water, both of them would have died from hypothemia long before the ship itself sank to the bottom.Third, Rose's character would have died even quicker floating on top of the piece of wood since the ocean wind is actually much colder than the water itself, not to mention the water on her body would have also caused hypothemia as well. Why her character was one of the few survivors is a puzzlement to credability of this film itself.This film will continue to divide moviegoers for many years, with many of it's fans liking it, and those who despise and hate Titanic, will also continue to do so.James Cameron had a great opportunity to explore the legacy of the famed sunken ship, but instead by focusing on a teenage romance, with banal dialoge, and two wooden leads, it definitely kills not only the storyline, but the credability of this film as well.In my opinion, Titanic does not hold up well to stand the test of time, and that is why it's easily the most overrated film in history in my opinion. His last great film was 1991's T2, as both True Lies and Titanic contained much of Cameron's famously banal dialoge and bloated budgets.",1
443,"When this movie came out everybody went and saw it.  One year later, everybody was making fun of it.  Okay, this was not a bad movie, however, it got way too much attention.  And now there should be regrets.  Because this was so popular for three months, we made it the highest grossing film of all time, something that even Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings couldn't beat, and it bumped such good films like Star Wars and ET off the list.  Plus, 14 Oscar nominations and twelve wins for that!!  The only thing that was fantastic about it, was the visula effects and music.",
444,"Titanic is not the greatest movie of all time ( except box office).  It is not the greatest movie of 1997.  The flaws are many: 1) We know the end to Titanic.  That makes the last hour and a half amazingly boring. 2) James Cameron trivialized it by using two fictional characters. 3) Not many of the performances were that great ( I liked Paxton, Bates, and Stewart) 4) Overlong",
445,"This is going to be a short review for Titanic.Plot: The plot of the film is really amazing. If you want a three-hour long love story, this is the movie for you. Another movie worth watching is ""A Walk to Remember"", starring Mandy Moore and it is a movie that I have seen and it is spectacular. The entire 196-minute picture centers around two lovers: one rich girl named Rose DeWitt Bukater and poor artist Jack Dawson (portrayed nicely by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio) as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during it's ill-fated maiden voyage.Characters and Story: James Cameron wrote a story that shines out, but the dialogue is very clichéd and cheesy in a few areas. The characters are all well portrayed and I give to the two main actors, also credit to Billy Zane, who plays Cal, he is the character you want to hate. Kathy Bates, Bernard Hill, Frances Fisher, Johnathan Hyde, Danny Nucci, David Warner, Bill Paxton and the late Gloria Stuart, who plays older Rose in this film and she should have deserved an Oscar.Visuals: This is where the movie shines. James Cameron wanted to make a movie about the Titanic and it shows, with it's $200 million dollar budget and he made this movie historically accurate as possible. The ship's sinking scene is one of the coolest thing they could do with CGI and practical effects and it is awesome.Sound / Music: The music is awesome and fantastic. James Horner composed a musical score and he is fantastic. The film's theme song, ""My Heart Will Go On"", performed by Celine Dion and I love it and a lot of people has did covers of this song and I listen to this version and it was fantastic.Enjoyment: TITANIC is a good classic, epic romantic disaster film that I have no problem watching once in a while. The film won 11 Oscars including Best Director, Best Picture and Best Original Song. It made $2 billion dollars worldwide and it is just fantastic. 10/10.",10
446,"Best film ever, most certainly not. Best film of 1997, again not in with a chance. I have to report that while watching ""Titanic"" I found myself being totally bored by the stereotypical charecters, i.e Snobbish English, Battleaxe American. Cameron has also reeled out loads of cliches and made them 10 times more boring. There is also an undertone of class struggle which is direly executed. As for ""Titanic"" being called a love story, that could never be said as there was no chemistry between the two leads and to me no feelings of love came across (James try watching other Oscar nominee As Good As It Gets for a decent love story). As for the tragedy that was Titanic in the film I did not feel as though the tragedy was fully put across and I left actually feeling numb from this glamourised dross. How this truly terrible film managed to get the Best Film Oscar is beyond me (As Good As It Gets a much better and beautiful film) and how Cameron got the Best Director award is unbelievable although is unsurprising when people like Martin Scorsese do not get an Oscar for films such as Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Mean Streets.",2
447,"Adventurers delve to the bottom of the ocean to search the ghostly remains of the Titanic. It's a very haunting moment because it still rests at the bottom of the ocean this day. They find a safe with a drawing of a young woman wearing a ruby known as 'The Heart of the Ocean'. They get a call from a 100 year old lady claiming the drawing is her.There is great chemistry between Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio who both give great performances. It's a groundbreaking achievement from the gorgeous cinematography, sound effects and editing. It's a very immersive experience as there is so much attention to detail with the incredible set designs, costume designs and makeup giving it a very authentic look. James Horners sweeping music score is heartfelt and intense. James Cameron is a magnificent director who before this made action sci-fi blockbusters like the Terminator films and The Abyss. He proves that he is very versatile filmmaker who can make more than just action films. Its no surprise the film won 11 Oscars and became the highest grossing film ever made.",10
448,"I really just wanted to vote on this film.  Contrary to what many say, this film does deserve the worst ratings and does NOT deserve to be in the top 250 or 500 or 5,000,000 (including Hollywood and Bollywood).  Come on people, get some life experience and develop the right side of that brain!!!",1
449,One of the most beautiful movies I have seen in my life,10
450,"The greatest film in the history of mankind, the most engaging love story ever made, this film has mesmerised me like no other on the face of earth. After watching once in childhood I watched this on again at the very start of 2011, and have ever since watched it a thousand times. I am such a huge fan of this film that I have even dedicated a poem to it, consisting of 53 verses (a shame I have never shared it online fearing plagiarism, a fear quite justified given the number of fans it has online). I also watched it at a cinema when it was released in 3D, on the 14th of April 2012, either hours or a day short of the tragedy's 100th anniversary!Each time I watch this film I tend to stay quiet a few hours afterwards and usually have that heaviness in my voice; it just affects my like no other film can. Just to avoid looking like an emotional fool, I usually start a conversation with anyone who happens to be sitting next to me so that I don't end up being in tears at the scene when Jack dies.The great thing about the love story was the joy that you so felt for them. So many hurdles stood in their way, there were so many things to fear from, yet they bore every hardship simply looking into each other's eyes. It is one great display of what the power of love is and what love can make us do. They way they rescue each other from one situation to the other, and the way the whole story builds up, and that once in a lifetime tragic ending scene, it is masterly work by James Cameron.Besides that, the whole depiction of the way the ship sinks, the horror in the end, the way the people die by either 'slipping' from it or in the freezing cold, the panic shown at the time it hits the iceberg, all of it is pure brilliance!Lastly, it should not at all be criticized for not being historically accurate, as for that you better watch a documentary film. They had to put up a build-up to the disaster that it was.",10
451,"I must've been drunk. The acting is wooden, the character development almost non-existent and the music irritating(I HATE Celine Dion). The FX are great, but who cares?. Of the cast, Leo has one good moment at the end, but it drags on. Kate looks terrible in her costumes, but it's nice to see she's not a twig. Pity she can't act. Billy Zane has seldom shown restraint, and this film is no exception. Oscar winner Kathy Bates, however is solid as an iceberg...er...rock as the ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown, but she can't save it. Jim Cameron has been responsible for many screen classics, but this isn't one of 'em. The dialogue is extremely funny. To give you an indication of how much I luuurrvved this film, the Federal election was on at the same time, and I decided to watch a bit of that!Would I have enjoyed it more on the big screen?Dialogue and characterisation is no different at the cinemas. The worst academy award nominated film of the year, but that's not saying much.",1
452,"""Titanic"" gave me too much touch. Shocked by the thrilling scenes, he occasionally left a line on the soft sandy beach in his heart. But now, it was completely moved by it, and it was deeply imprinted into the memory. Even when the fireworks were set off on New Year's Eve, I saw the fireworks rising, blooming, and falling in the dark night sky. I remembered the distress signal sent by the captain when the Titanic was killed. The fireworks also rose to the vast starry sky, bloomed, and landed on the infinite sea. And the naive little girl on the boat smiled happily because she saw the beautiful fireworks. I still feel heartache when I think of it. People's feelings will always get deeper and deeper with age. After many years, the 11-time Oscar-winning ""Titanic"" can still travel through time and space and shake people's hearts.",10
453,"Titanic is one of the best films of all time for many reasons. There is not one single problem with the picture. Not one. The effects are extraordinary, it's well acted, well written, convincing and spellbinding.Two lovers from opposite worlds fall in love aboard the doomed ship titanic. And then the ship meets her doom. Their relationship is strengthened by their struggle to survive. This makes the film an experience instead of just entertainment.Titanic has been bashed by many people for years. All I can say is that i think it is the second best film ever (behind shawshank), and that i don't care what they think.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate winslet are stunning and they give the film a basic story structure. Now these people can act.James Cameron cleverly shows the peril that the passengers are in. We can relate to them, and we fear for them. It is horrifying to see them die. It is an intense and visceral experience.This is a beautiful masterpiece about the tragic sinking of a great ship. super.",10
454,"It's sad to hear people whine about this movie saying that if it doesn't have good effects, it's a bad movie. Then they say it has weak acting and a predictible storyline. First of all: predictible story? Hello....people ?....did we all suddenly forget this was a real event? I actually had people get mad at me when I told them the ship sank. Then there's criticism of the bad effects. I personally have never been more convinced in seeing the ship break apart. You really feel like you are on the boat itself. The visual effects are truly stunning. And for those that are so concentrated on effects alone, I'd like to see them do better. This is a wonderful yet tragic love story with sub plots of societal segregation and female opression. Those that think on a higher plane and truly understand love, sacrifice and loss will like this movie. Those that criticize it forget that 1,500 people lost their lives in this tragedy, and I don't think the dead would give a darn about the effects or the acting.",
455,"Titanic
This movie will make you laugh, cry, and learn all in one
!Such a beautiful love story. one of the most legendary movies ever made, and i love it so much!
So acting is really amazing, leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are both so talented and they nailed their parts! the plot is super good, and i don't think this classic contains any negative things, except jack's death and the fact that this movie is very sad.. but i'm still like this film
.Also my family's members are so like this film.",10
456,"I forget what prompted me to see Titanic for the first time -- I think it was a comment I read in an article by a Japanese man who said he was moved by the bravery of the men putting wives and children aboard lifeboats and telling gallant lies to comfort the little ones.See it I did, however, and I was so visually stunned I entirely missed how lousy the movie was.I went to see it a second time because my son had been reading about the Titanic and wanted to see how the sinking was depicted. This time I noticed how lame the characters and plot were.I went to see it a third time because a friend of mine who doesn't have a car asked me to bring him and offered to treat me and my kids to popcorn and sodas, and pay for our tickets, if I'd take him. That last time I left the theater absolutely outraged.Titanic is a sorry example of the moral decay of western civilization. Characters we were supposed to sympathize with were elbowing women and children out of their way to save their own miserable skins. Instead of reaching out to help the woman clutching a baby, Kate and Leo reminisce about the night they met. Leonardo hefts the worthless and shallow Kate onto the floating door to save her life, when he could have saved a dozen innocent children instead. Titanic was a monumental ego-trip and monument to selfishness. The only sympathetic characters were the designer, the captain, and the Irish widow with the two small children. I could smack Cameron in frustration -- imagine what a wonderful plot he could have built around this woman and Kate's shallow character! Picture it -- the widow flees Ireland to join her brother in America after the town rich creep offers to save her from poverty at the expense of her virtue. The widow sees Kate on the railing and gives her a picture of what suffering really is. Take it from there -- it can go in any number of directions far more interesting than the cookie-cutter lust story. Pathetic.As I told my kids on the drive home from the theater, ""If you every survive a shipwreck by ignoring the cries of drowning children, don't bother coming home.""",4
457,"This film is underrated and yet so beautiful! In 1997, the world was introduced to a heartbreaking, uplifting film which provides you 3 hours and 20 minutes or so with romance, adventure, danger, the spirit of kindness, offering the person you love your own life (just like Jack Dawson did for Rose). I ask you - what more can a movie give you? Tell me that! Even the scenes like when Rose takes off her clothes and Jack draws her naked, and the moderate/strong bad language which comes in frequently doesn't put me off. I think the certificate should've been 15+. I personally do not think the mature sequences in this movie are suitable for a big kid aged 12. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are the our stars in this outstanding epic. Their characters are far from similar because Rose is rich and she mixes with snobby people and yet she doesn't like them at all and she's also feisty. Jack is poor and likes to hang out with his mates and despite his rough edges, he has a heart of gold! He is such a loving, selfless young man who even took his own life. Anyway, when Rose can't put up with being somebody she doesn't want, she bolts out of Titanic's main restaurant and attempts to commit suicide by jumping off the ship. Jack sees what she's doing and insists that she doesn't drop off the railing. At first she tells him to goaway, but he holds out his hand and she gives him her hand. She slips and nearly falls into the sea. He uses all his strength to lift her back onto the boat. From then, they gradually fall in love with each other. This feature-film makes me cry big tears every time I see it. I sob in the same way a person would do if they were mourning the death of a loved one. I feel as if I may not stop crying for at least an hour after the film finishes. Even some of the scenes that aren't sad make me cry. Like; when Jack feels upset when Rose tries to avoid him because she's engaged to Cal Hockley (a heartless and violent man) just to please him but the evening of the day when she tells him not to keep seeing her she has a sudden change of mind and comes to see him at the front of ""Titanic"". He reaches for her hand and tells her to step up onto the railing, let her arms spread out while he supports her and then she believes she's flying and at that point they kiss. It's shot beautifully against evening pink skies - it's just so tearful, knowing this couple are sharing their final evening together and- (Sniffles). Rose says to Jack ""Jack when the ship docks, I'm getting off with you!"", sadly, what I say is ""you mean IF the ship docks!"" and from there all the tragedy of Titanic's collision into the iceberg will come in in only a short matter of time. When it happens Jack is held prisoner right at the bottom of the ship and they leave him there even when the ship is sinking! Luckily, Rose comes to his rescue and releases him. Then, as Rose is rich and Jack is poor, Rose is forced to board a boat and as it lowers he hand which is holding Jack's is pulled away. Cal Hockley menacingly says to Jack as she leaves, ""I always win, Jack"" - uh, not this time buster! But she leaps off the lifeboat and runs to his arms. He runs to her, too, and that's also too emotional to be true. But there's more tragedy to come. When the entire ship sinks to the bottom, after ""the ship's arse snaps"" as that man said at the beginning, Jack and Rose spot a board afloat but it's too small for them BOTH, so very selflessly, Jack lifts her onto the board and he stays in the freezing water. ""You have got to promise me that you'll survive, that you'll make babies and watch them grow. Promise me, Rose, that you'll die a little old lady warm in her bed. But not here, not this night! That divorce was the best thing that ever happened to me it brought me to you. Please, make me that promise."" He kisses her hand for the last time. Rose later tells Jack there's a boat to save them - but he doesn't answer or even move. He has frozen to death. Rose cannot believe it but bravely lets him sink; now I know I'll cry! WHAT A SAD MOVIE!!! But, despite its trauma, ""Titanic"" is irresistible. Over 15s won't be able to help but succumb to its beauty. Far better than the offensive ""Gone with the Wind"". Rose may be feisty but she's certainly not a self-obsessed harpy like Scarlett O'Hara and Jack Dawson is anything but that arrogant cad Rhett Butler, the womanising scumbag! Titanic is VERY underrated and ""Gone With The Wind"" is VERY overrated - absurd but, cest la vie!Gloria Stuart was 86 when she starred as old Rose and with this film she is most associated. Her final film was ""Lands of Plenty"" in 2004. The following year, she contracted cancer but had always appeared well to the public eye. She also looked frail in her old age. James Cameron attended her 100th birthday. For a moment I thought she'd live forever! I am deeply saddened to report that Gloria Stuart died of cancer last Sunday. She was 100 years old. God love her! I showed my mother a beautiful tribute to her on Youtube and she revealed that she could feel Gloria's energy around me, she felt her there. Apparently she put her arm round me then blew me a kiss goodbye.A divine and inspirational woman...GLORIA STUART4th July 1910-26th September 2010",10
458,"What is 7.8
It should be 9.6
Great acting ,great visuals ,great directing
Great sound track 👌 and everything is mind-blowing
Titanic imbd rating is very low
I can watch it again and again",10
459,"I am guilty. I am guilty of raving about this stupendously horrendous film initially. It took awhile to, well, 'sink' in. History won't forgive James Cameron who had the nerve to take one of the biggest tragedies and reduce it to a sappy love story.Just imagine yourself as one of the passengers on that ill-fated ship. Imagine the helplessness, the horror you experienced before drowning. Now imagine someone showing you this flick which makes it look like this disaster was all about a pair of stupid love-birds who thought they were at their charming best in a spitting contest. God knows I'm sorry. We all should be.",
460,"Looking at all the reviews before mine, it seems that Titanic either is hated or loved to the extreme either way. My verdict is that it's very entertaining as a mindless special effects fest but as a Titanic enthusisast for some years before it's release can find much fault.Firstly it's historically poor, key to this is the scene where Officer Murdoch shoots a passenger then shoots himself, after taking bribe money. My problem here is that this Officer Murdoch actually existed and is it really fair 85 years on to make out that he got up to such business? Another gripe is the script and acting, it's terrible, not least some of the lines between Winslett and De Caprio. Somehow all the actors seem to be too uncomfortable to deliver their lines naturally. Much as I approve of seeing a 1930s era actress in a late 90s blockbuster (Gloria Stuart) I really can't stand her dialogue delivery, I assume they had called Fay Wray first.There are positives, the sinking is exciting enough, in other words good special effects, which seems to be enough for some people. I even rather like the very final scene, where Rose is reunited with all the people on the ship who died, but to call this the best film ever is perhaps going a wee bit too far.Perhaps having seen both 'Titanic 1952' with a very well throughout family tradigy, and the more documentary style 'Night to Remember 1958' I was never going to fall in love with James Cameron's effort, I reckon Kenneth More would of told him where he could stick the line 'I'll shoot you all like dogs' One more moan, 'De Witt Buckator' Most unintentionally awful movie name ever!",5
461,"One of my favorite films is Titanic.This movie tells the dramatic story of the Titanic from the main actors are Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet.The movie starts from 1912 a young poor guy, travels by the gorgeous ship Titanic from London to New York with big dream. On the ship he meets a fabulous, wealthy girl.Then he fells in love with her as soon as he sees her.After a few day the ship hits an enormous iceberg and tragedy begins to unfold.The Titanic starts sinking.The movie shows a beautiful love story with an extremely sad ending. The acting is first-rate. Leonardo Di Caprio's and kate Winslet's performance is so brilliant that l cried during the whole movie.Jack and Rose, they both have amazing personality and who watched this story no one wanted Jack to die but it was really good how it went with the story.There is also some comedy and romance.And this movie will brings a tear to your eyes. I have watched this movie for third time that make me cries every time. The love story goes deeper in meaning than any other.In some ways this movie is also a tribute to the power of memory and means so much.Because the story between both of them was not only a beautiful love story but it also captured the societal pressure of a young and wealthy woman in their time.So I absolutely love this movie in every single way possible.",8
462,This is a classic movie I watched as a child with my family. The whole family gathered around the TV and watched. My whole family loves it. People discuss many details in the movie after watching.The content is about the classic shipwreck and the love between Jack and Rose. These are also my two favorite movie actors.,8
463,"Forget all the hype. Forget that since this tradegy happened, it has been America's most popular story.  If you strip all the attention surrounding this movie away, you're left with a big-budget film that is just that - big-budget.  The film overwhelms itself with a ridiculous amount of foreshadowing.  The acting is nothing to be accoladed.  I wasn't even impressed with the magnificent Kathy Bates' performance.  The costumes, special effects, and soundtrack were all good points in the film, however I do not like the fact that the Academy awarded this film so heavily.  It was simply an overhyped epic, not a film worthy of 11 of Hollywood's most prestigious award.  James Cameron's ego-driven direction really spoils this movie.  I would recommend seeing this movie just because it IS the tragedy of the century, but don't fall into the trap of thinking this is a quality piece of filmmaking.  I voted 5/10.",5
464,It's the love of your life & you're going to just let him freeze to death while you lay sprawled on the door?Incredible. Couldn't believe that part. Unbelievable.,
465,"First of all, as a long time student of the Titanic disaster and member of several Titanic clubs, I feel entitled to comment on the film. I don't really care how many awards and accolades the film won, but to me it is still an absolutely awful film. Cameron had the resources to make a 'proper' semi-documentary film of the disaster but unfortunately chose to turn it into a po-faced romantic mush. The fact that so many people around the world fell for it only shows, to my mind, the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days. Whoever said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love? In fact most real events are anything but romantic and the Titanic disaster certainly was not one. I feel that it needed a better script and director with a semi-documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible. I almost threw up in the last sequence where the 'dead' lovers meet among the other lost passengers and crew who break out in applause. Is this an intelligent film? Ask yourself.",1
466,I genuinely completely and totally believe that watching this movie is the equivalent of falling in love. It's perfect.,10
467,I was so surprised and disappointed to see that the Titanic sank at the end. It's such a sad and unnecessary twist that nobody saw coming.,
468,"How can we live in a world where a piece of *%^@ film like Titanic can even be considered for an Academy Award?  Now I understand that I must give some credit to Mr. Cameron for spending WAY too much on minor details (such as the ships's engine) which could have easily been avoided.  This is the obvious case of a man who needs to spend as much money as possible for publicity? Anyone remember the last time that stunt was pulled?  It was called ""Waterworld"" - and was equally as bad and chessy.  The only difference was that ""Waterworld"" did not take place around a real event - and that is the ONLY reason Titanic won Best Picture, oh and how I can forget the ludicrous special effects!!!  In my humble opionion no film that isn't at least nominated for Best Screenplay should be able to take home the Best Picture award.  Mr. Cameron must have written his script after an inspiration of something he saw floating in a toilet.  I'm sorry to say this Mr. Oscar, but you've lost my respect.",
469,"I first saw ""Titanic"" in fairly early 1998, I think, here in Australia. I went with a girl I had recently got to know on the Internet. She had already seen it, and spoke in raptures about it after we left the cinema, while I was hesitating somewhat, as I was not sure about what I had just witnessed. Since then, I have seen the film at least twice more, including just now, and I stick by my opinion that I have never seen a movie that is so bad and so good at the same time. The bad, as so many people have said, is the script. Well, the characters too. The main romance is so embarrassingly contrived as to be juvenile, and this is not helped by the character of Rose. Quite frankly, I can't stand her, and can only wonder why Jack did not push the little brat off the ship when he had the chance. Speaking of Jack, I liked him. He and Molly Brown were, by far, the two best characters shown. I'm not bagging the acting of Winslett. I think she did well. I just thought her character was loathsome. Not much better is Cal. I couldn't stand him either, and yes, I know you're not meant to like him, but I didn't like the way I didn't like him! Talk about a corny villain. Snobby, cowardly... by the time he picked up the child to get his way off the ship, I was thinking, ""Alright, we get the idea. He's a creep."" Really, I thought the whole ""first class and the rest"" concept was overdone. Yes, I know it was an issue, but it's so clumsy and obvious as to be cringe worthy. But probably the worst and most disappointing character was the captain. Here was someone I would have loved to got to know. Ultimately, the sinking was all his fault. Yet there was no depth to him, instead just coming off as a feeble human being who did and said little, and who looked (understandably) more and more desolate as he saw what was happening. But then there is the good. The sinking. Absolutely incredible. I am always fascinated by the fact that the ship started to sink but, as is the nature of such events, everything looks normal for a while. People moved around as usual, the ship just kept motoring along. And yet we knew it would be under water in a couple of hours. The gradual submersion is enthralling, and technically brilliant. This is why I like to come back to the film, and no it's not because I'm a disaster fan (which I am) who just wants to see people die and not care about things like romance. Not at all. Really, no. A key to such films is depth of character and their relationships with each other. No real people means no emotional charge when said disaster happens. The effects are breathtaking, and the model work stunning. I can't enthuse enough about this part of the film.But the bad comes close to killing it all, and my view does not change after each time I see it. ""Titanic"" polarises me like no other film I've ever seen. It is awful. It is tremendous. Ultimately, the mixture makes it a middling film at best, which is a great shame. How it won Best Picture at the Oscars remains one of the biggest jokes in cinema history. But maybe, if we can forget about the bad, we can revel in the good, and appreciate some of the most stunning moments ever filmed in Hollywood.",6
470,"Dear GOD, this movie amazed me. What amazed me more were the sheep that bought into it, and the little lambs that were allowed in. This is a movie with nudity, sex, violence and some very disturbing images that are not appropriate for young children.Ok, now on to the review. My friend dragged me to this over the march break last year, and I am only now getting past my disappointment to discuss it reasonably. To all those who think it is the greatest movie of all time I would love to know what your criteria is. Do you go by acting? Outside of Kathy Bates and some minor players, there is none. I got about as much emotion out of Leo as I did out of my hampster in her final days. Winslet was bareable, although I cannot comprehend her bearing all, unless James felt that the teen-age male was an important demographic.Now you cannot completely fault the actors, because the script was hardly anything to shout about (unless you are the ranting and raving type.) ""I have seen the iceberg and now I see it in your eyes,"" could not be any more sappy. It was full of little bits of dialogue that were laughably out of historical context, and the characters could not be more cliched... which brings me to the story itself.It was as if someone took all the period pieces about class disparity and jammed them through a meat grinder. All the juice (ie. plot and intrigue) leaked out of the bottom, and a squishy,  messy, mixed up movie was the result. The kind, young, talented pauper falls in love with the rich, testy, unhappy girl who is betroethed to the evil industrialist. Joan Collins would be impressed...Basically, if you want loud noise, and don't mind a few tits, plus you can survive 2 hours of boredom interspersed, this movie is worth it. Otherwise, you haven't hit puberty yet, or you really need to watch some real movies, like Citizen Kane or On the Waterfront.",3
471,"This movie is my second favorite movie ever ( the first, being Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End. Both movies that take place on the ocean. )! Although, I never cry in movies, this movie is really, really sad. Like Jack Dawson's death. What's weird is my name is Jack, and the first letter of my last name is D. Anyway, this movie turned 20 years old this year ( 2017 ). I am 12 and I love this movie.Except for that one scene where Jack was sketching Rose. 😣.",10
472,"It is true that this movie was over rated when it first came out. It made a billion dollars at the box office and it was on the IMDB top 250 with a rating of 9.6! It was all the rave. But the rating slowly started to sink (no pun intended) and it got low as a 6.9. The movie received extreme backlash. The past few years the rating has been increasing. Titanic has been going through what I like to call ""the rating roller coaster."" It's ratings are constantly changing since everyone has so many different opinions on this movie. I feel kinda bad for it...I understand why so many people don't like this movie. The love story really isn't anything new or different, and the main character Rose can be annoying at times. And of course, like many other people, I am really annoyed about the whole Jack could have survived thing. Like seriously, they both could have fit on the giant floating door! Rose acted like she loved Jack so much, but she barely even tried to get him to fit on the door. All she had to do was move over a little. They wouldn't have even been in the situation if Rose hadn't jumped back on the ship. She should have stayed put in that lifeboat and waited for Jack. He would have had a better chance of surviving, cause then he just has to worry about himself. I feel like their love story may have been a bit exaggerated. I mean, it's good that they wanted to be together forever, but they had only known each other for like four days! Most people don't fall in love that easily or that fast.I have only watched this movie when it comes on TV, and I haven't seen the whole thing because it's SO long. It's like 3 hours. I love the last hour of the movie, which is the boat sinking. I love how it's done and how it's handled. It fills me with suspense every time I watch it. I don't really like anything else about this movie, just the boat sinking. And no, not because people die. It's because it's so suspenseful. I think the way it was handled was really what it was like in 1912.",5
473,"This film never sinks. From the opening few shots to the final moments of the film, everything about it is simply wonderful. It's majestic, charming, sweet, thrilling, suspenseful and most of all heart wrenching. The pacing of the film is perfect and the special effects towards the end of the film are also top notch. The story is about two young lovers Jack and Rose. It really is a beautiful love story as we see them overcoming the odds in order to be together. But don't be put off by the love story element, as there's plenty of action and excitement come the second half of the film and the film never sinks for one moment. Like I said, the pacing is perfect and I must say this is probably the greatest story telling ever put to celluloid - James Camerons a genius. All the actors/actresses are great, but for me it's Leonardo DiCaprio's movie as his character Jack, demonstrates his self worth at every turn and goes to extraordinary lengths in order for him and Rose to be together and ultimately stay together i.e survive the catastrophe that may fore-go their destinies. To conclude, phenomenal.",10
474,"I don't understand all the bad reviews here. I'm not given to getting syrupy over romance films, but this one actually was pretty good.A telling of the true story of the sinking of the ship Titanic, but this movie is first and foremost a romance movie. Kate Winslet is beautiful, and though they could have cast a better male lead, Leo DiCaprio is not too bad.The real star of this film is the sinking ship sequence. It is quite realistic and the cold weather and fright of that night back in 1912 is at least partly captured --- it must have been a terrible event for the poor souls on board that vessel. The moment that was most poignant to me was when Captain Smith went back to his bridge and realized the ocean was about to break through his giant windows.Recommended for all who love a good romance film.",9
475,"Titanic rocks, combining elements of dark brooding drama with all the T&A of a typical late night cinemax show.  With the president held hostage and locked in a frigidaire 200 feet under the ocean, Scotland Yard calls in the help of their #1 hit man to save the world.  He is TITANIC, a cyborg soldier genetically altered so that his face looks kinda like a bull when he gets miffed.  When the enemy organization known as D.U.M.B. (Democratic Underground Mob Brigade) finds out, they threaten to destroy the world with the help of their evil underlings, GWAR.  With the plot laid out, the action explodes as our hero fights his way across the world to save the helpless president (played by Lloyd Bridges) and maybe kill a few bad guys on the way.  Check this film out.  (Also starring Jake Lloyd, Jake Roberts, James Snuka, H.H.Hogan, Tori Spelling, Tom Selleck, Burgess Meredith (as SATAN), and Pee Wee Herman (as GOD).",

477,"A film of such incredible proportions is a rarity in cinema. 'Titanic,' was recently re-released on Blu-Ray, and I took the opportunity to watch the film for the first time in over a decade. I was 8 years old when I last saw this film, something which probably contributed to my opinion that the film was over-long, soppy and incredibly dull. How wrong I was.'Titanic,' is epic cinema at its finest. So many aspects of the film are truly wonderful, the scale, the performances and the design to name a few. James Cameron has repeatedly cemented himself as one of the most talented directors in Hollywood, managing to craft gargantuan products with colossal budgets and still maintain a wonderful human emotion to his works. Though the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 serves as the basis for this film, the true meat of it is a love story between two young people from polar opposite ends of society; Jack Dawson, played by a boyish Leonardo DiCaprio, a lower class drifter with a gift for art, and Rose, a higher class young woman trapped in the confines of a loveless engagement, portrayed by a fresh-faced Kate Winslet. Over the course of 3 hours and 14 minutes their love story plays out among the hundreds of stories of that fateful voyage that tragically killed so many.The true wonder of 'Titanic,' is its sheer scale. The film was originally released in 1997, yet the production dwarfs that of most large scale films of today's Hollywood. The costume design and set production is absolutely staggering, truly worthy of the Oscars the design and production won. The special effects are also worth praising, especially considering that the film is now 15 years old. However, with the transition to Blu-Ray, and the clarity that the image receives because of the transfer, some of the effects are unfortunately rather obvious, though this does nothing to detract from the overall experience. The sound design is also excellent, particular praise reserved for the score. There is an almost Enya-like quality to the score, gentle and mellow yet rousing in all the correct places.The performances are all excellent. DiCaprio and Winslet both carry the production on their young shoulders, and do so with aplomb. Their chemistry is impressive, and both actors are pleasant and likable. Billy Zane, as Rose's arrogant fiancé, is suitably horrid and despicable, and Zane gives probably the best performance of his career. All roles are performed well, including Kathy Bates as a 'new-money,' socialite and Bernard Hill as the captain of the doomed voyage. There are so many moments from this film that are frequently quoted and fondly remembered, and there's a reason. 'Titanic,' is an incredible experience, and well worth picking up on Blu-Ray. I'm certainly glad I did.",9
478,"Today marks the 110th anniversary of that tragic cold night the titanic sank and so many lost their lives. It is a small tribute, but i feel this movie and all the attention it gets, helps us all to remember and honor those who perished.I did not see titanic in theatres, in fact i actively avoided it for many years, because i heard it was a melodramatic chick flick. But I am so relieved now that i decided to rent it one day from my local video store and see why this movie had one of the biggest box office records ever. I was not ready. Not only was i engrossed, i was blown away by the epic scenes of this movie. The acting, the visuals, the action, the music, it just captured my cynical heart, it was in every word an EPIC, and here are the reasons why that is.The Story: we all know what happened on April 15th 1912, and despite that, this movie does a excellent job building up to that fateful moment. Planting so many easter eggs and comments that in hindsight, the dialogue seems prophetic. ""Not even God himself could sink this ship"". James Cameron takes care to include as many historical accurate individuals and occurrences on the ship, and they all occur around the fictional couple of jack and rose. Rose is a heiress traveling with her fiancee and mother, and feels that she is being shock by her extravagant but depressing lifestyle. Which is why Jack plays such a monumental role in her life as he provides her an escape from her old life. This love story is told by a 100 year old rose, who is revisiting her memories of her voyage aboard the titanic, to help a treasure hunting crew find the Heart of the Ocean diamond that she wore all those years ago.The Characters: Jack is a simple guy, a traveling artist who wants to see the world and live life to the fullest, his speech at dinner about how life is a gift describes perfectly the kind of man he is. Rose, is the main character of the film, she is a troubled soul, and she desires a life with no chains, after meeting jack, her growth from a proper lady to a badass is very smooth and she obtains the life she always wanted through struggle and determination. Billy zane is the perfect villain who should have played lex luthor (He was even bald!)he sees himself as royalty and looks down upon those who dont meet his perfection, despite this, he is a very likable character just not for the right reasons. Favrizzio is jacks italian best friend, and i feel he was cheated since there a lot of deleted scenes of him that makes him more of a character, in the end he was heroic for cutting the boats free but sadly still died. There are so many characters in this film worth exploring that the run time of this film is just not enough, which is why i always wished for a mini series(i know one aleady exist s but i want one with this cast). There are just so many wonderful characters in this film, that everytime i watch it, i focus on a different person. Many of the people seen on the boat were actual historical figures, that cameron does a great job bringing them back to life. Also, there are many instances of people doing things that actually happened in the film, such as the little boy playing with his father, foreign people not understanding whats happening, the band playing, and women jumping back on the ship to be with their men, its all so poetically tragic to see these people.The Ship: Yes the ship deserves its own character study, its the name of the movie for crying out loud. The design of the ship itself is fantastic, cameron truly spent every penny he had making the set look as glorious as it did when it first existed. James Cameron truly resurrected this great ship, that was worthy of its name ""The Titanic"". Everytime i watch the take off of the ship, i always feel i have been transported back in time, and i am aboard, filled with excitement and melancholy. The foreshadowing of the ships fate is just excellent with its creator, Mr Andrews commenting about the shortage of boats, the speeding up by the captain, despite the risk of icebergs. I love seeing every part of the ship explored, such as the scene where jack and rose are jogging through the boiler room and the lower decks. Of course this ship comes more to life when it begins to sink. Showing every level being filled with water until it reaches the top. The lighting of the water makes the sinking ship look so atmospheric. Cameron had to flood the set for real in order to capture this epic scope of every room being filled with water. Mr andrews represents the heart of the ship and how sad it feels to have failed to deliver its passengers to land. There are also so many striking visuals that bring the ship even more to life, such as a woman in a dress drowned. The mother and children and elderly couple in bed. Roses picasso paintings .the dishes shattering. That shot of hordes of people running up to the tip of the boat. The priest praying.the boat rising, just so many instances and visuals that elevate the tragedy of the death of titanic. She was a good ship, strong and true, but alas she died along with her passengers.The Music: My God the Music! What more can be said? While the lyrics and celine dions voice make the song ""my heart will go on"" one of the most emotional pieces ever, it is the instrumental theme that is unbearably melancholy to me when played in highly emotional scenes such as the kiss scene and the ending in heaven.Conclusion: There are so many genres in this film, a romance, a action thriller, a horror film, and a thought provoking film about not being afraid to live. This movie is so extra with the themes of horrors in the hallways and the action thriller with billy zane using a gun the flooding in the halls I will admit i am not a fan of the goodbye between jack and rose not because it sad but because its kind of laughable. After all the horror and sudden death, we are getting this long winded speech from jack. There are several issues i have with this movie, but none of them can over come the cinematic brilliance that Cameron accomplished. I never watched this movie in theaters, not even the re-releases, but by God do I want to do it now. I watch this movie every year on the anniversary of the sinking, in my own way this movie allows me to remember the ship and the people who died in the north Atlantic ocean. This movie will forever live in my memory.",8
479,"The only romance movie that doesn't feel contrived, it brings you back to a time where you could love with careless abandon. The freeing nature of the two characters and breaking from their social classes to be together is very Romeo and Juliet, but the intense romance between them is something to be seen. That love alongside the unusual combination of a disaster paints a strangely beautiful picture of love.",9
480,"Sure, the script was undistinguished. If it were not, this would be one of the true great movies of all time. As it is, the visual beauty of the movie, the wonderful score, the fine acting, and the very nature of the tragedy made this an unforgettable movie for me. Movies rarely can rise above a less than great script; the genius of Cameron is that in this case, he was able to do it. I am amazed that anyone could be so unemotional as to not cry as the end of this movie. While on my first viewing, I was indeed a little dismayed that this was not another ""Night to Remeber"", all this was forgotten on my second viewing as I got swept away by it all.  And I can't imagine what other movie from the Best Picture nominees should have won over Titianic. Certinaly not the very overrated and dull LA Confidential, or the annoying and maudlin ""Good Will Hunting"", or the charming, but lightweight ""Full Monty.""  Titanic got every award it deserved, and did not get the ones it didn't. 9 out of 10.",
481,"""In every age mankind attempts to fabricate great works at once magnificent and impossible"" - Titanic the musical Like the Titanic itself, this movie is a masterpiece that stands the age of time. It gives me the shivers every time I watch it. I love this film not for the love story but for the depiction of every passenger on board. You see the hopefulness in every one when boarding, not knowing what awaits ahead. And you see the tragic horrors unfold as the Titanic sunk. Cameron portrayed the human condition when everyone fights to survive and the social differences very well.Considering this is a 1997 film, it's still better than a lot of new films today, both story-wise and special effects wise.",10
482,"This film shares a lot of parallels with the legendary Gone With the Wind. It is a romantic spectacle set against the backdrop of historical events and became both a huge Oscar-winning success and the surprise box office behemoth of its era. Another similarity it shares with the former is that following the success it is now considered ""hip"" to be derogatory and dismiss it as a Hollywood film. It is a Hollywood film, but not in the insulting manner that detractors would indicate. It is a sublime demonstration of what can happen when a visionary director puts his reputation on the line and uses the limits of what Hollywood has to offer to bring it to the screen.The film opens in present day with a group of scientific treasure hunters exploring the remains of the sunken Titanic in an effort to locate a priceless necklace. Instead, they find a preserved portrait of a young woman. The elderly woman, Rose (Gloria Stuart), is located and brought to the site to relate her story of the last days of the Titanic and the film unfolds. It is a familiar romantic tale with rich-in-name-only Rose (now played by Kate Winslet) betrothed against her will to a boorish millionaire. In a fit of pique, she contemplates suicide and is talked out of it by charming penniless artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). During the remainder of the ill-fated voyage, they fall in love and incur the wrath of her fiancé and her mother, until the fateful iceberg and destiny in the icy waters of the North Atlantic intervene.There are so many ways that the film could have gone wrong, but director James Cameron wisely sidesteps them. Much of the fuel used by the detractors of the film would have turned it into an infinitely weaker production. Evidence of Cameron's sure narrative hand can be found in numerous spots. Starting the film with the treasure hunters provides for a brilliant moment which allows them to recreate on a computer the death throes of the Titanic so that when the final 90 minutes begin the viewer is completely aware of why certain things are occurring as they do. It also offers a wonderful opportunity for 1930s film star Gloria Stuart to show her acting chops as the latter day Rose.Cameron also gives us a strong scope of the immensity of the great ship herself, as well as the class differentiation in the status of the clientele traveling therein. Much has been made of centering the film on the two characters of Jack and Rose, while having the remainder of the cast play support rather than spread the wealth around more. One could and has done that: it is called The Poseidon Adventure. The reason why this film works on so many levels is because it is far more than the standard disaster epic. The fact that the action is basically consolidated through the eyes of young lovers streamlines the film and keeps the action focused, and Cameron comes up with increasingly inventive ways to move them through different parts of the ship to cover as much action as possible. The fact that they are young lovers experiencing their first romance provides a vitality and sense of urgency that may have been missing from older protagonists. Many have sneered over much the ""Jack"" ""Rose"" ""Jack"" dialog interaction in the climactic moments as a lack of good writing, but given that we are talking about teenage lovers in serious peril, one wonders if people expected them to quote intellectual diatribes back and forth. Instead, what comes from their mouths is far more likely and believable, if repetitive. Further, look at how often Cameron takes the narrative high road. When Jack is invited by the rich people to join them for dinner for saving Rose early in the film, he could have punctured the egos of the rich and wowed Rose with his coarseness. Instead, he behaves in a totally mature fashion and ends up charming the majority of those at their table. The film is brimming with memorable sequences, including the highly sensual moment when Rose invites Jack to draw her portrait or the (much parodied) scene of the two lovers embracing at the front of the ship as it skims the water. For detractors that claim that the special effects involving the sinking of the Titanic save the film, it makes their argument untenable when so many audiences have already been won over long before the sinking begins. The climactic moments are intense, heart-breaking and unforgettable.The majority of the film's success (aside from Cameron) must be attributed to the leads. I would never have previously cast them as a couple, but DiCaprio and Winslet have chemistry. Not just any chemistry, but the chemistry of which cinematic legends are made. Winslet provides a warm, sympathetic and resonant presence throughout the film portraying a character that proves much stronger than even she initially believes. She draws you into the action and her final moments rank as some of her best acting. Conversely, although I admit DiCaprio is a good actor, I am not usually much of a fan. Here, I cannot see anyone else in this role. It is a distinct departure from anything else that he has attempted and he has no acting ""hook"" on which to hinge his work. Playing a larger-than-life character that clicks with the audience is one of the trickiest obstacles, but when Rose declares that ""he saved me in every way that a person can be saved"" DiCaprio makes you believe it. The fact that he makes it appear so effortless probably resulted in his Oscar nomination snub, but the truth is that he is definitely the worthy Gable to Winslet's Leigh.",9
483,"I am sick of people saying this is a bad film. Get used to it, this was a breathtaking journey, it deserved all its 11 Oscars and all its success. I am extremely surprised that it isn't in the IMDb Top 250.I liked everything about this movie, the performances from Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates and Billy Zane were all impressive, but this time, the performances aren't the sparkle in the film. It is really the effort that went into the direction, visual effects, sound and sound editing and musical score that made the film such a sparkling, memorable gem.This is the best film of 1997 no doubt, and after which will soon be 4 years, I still can't stop thinking about this amazing achievement.Rating: 10",10
484,"Titanic delivers,on that there is no doubt,its a supreme blockbuster,the acting is good and the script fairly good.Its the classic boy meets girl story on the doomed voyage,it has been unfairly riticised for not having a documentry approach but if you want that try the splendid A night to remember. The main characters are well developed,personally I would like a bit more sub plot,but because Rose and Jack become real people it makes the story so much more moving.The last hour is simply breathtaking and one asks the question of one self how would I behave in that situation.So watch this film in April every year and thank God you weren't there. 8/10",
485,"Just as the ship that couldn't be sunk sank in 1910, the movie ""Titanic"" which should not have failed went belly up and fell to the bottom of the sea. I seem to be going against the grain here and maybe I was the only one seeing this movie who didn't get it. I readily that there are great moments in this movie. The dramatic sequence where the Titantic ship becomes flooded with water and eventually sinks to the bottom is brilliant. What director James Cameron also does very well in exposing the sheer unfairness that some were allowed on the life boats, while others were not. In that connection, there was a emotive scene with a navy officer who, often against his own will, enforced this unfair system to the letter, not because it was the right thing to do, but because there were only so many life boats to go around and the prevailing view was that the few life boats available should go to the rich -- with the result that the rest were, in effect, left to die. What is also very good is that scene where some of the passengers are floating in the ice cold water, clinging on to whatever they could get their hands on, and quickly freezing to death.Yet, the film still does not quite work because of what preceded this sad, dramatic tragedy that was the sinking of the titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack and Kate Winslet's Rose were plausible characters, but they were very annoying to watch. Some of their lines were so out of place and absurd that I felt deeply embarrassed watching these people. The love story seemed rather contrived and unbelievable. Finally, James Horner's music in the background just made the whole thing worse. In short, I did not feel anything for these characters or identify with their love story; and that, more than anything else, was what dragged this movie down.",5
486,"Spoilers! (ahahh-ahh!! .. rememberin the late Sam K)This is a film which simply doesn't hold up upon repeated viewing. In fact, this is the only film I have, that I purchased, that seemed to get palpably worse each time I viewed it. Really, it SHOULD have won the Oscar. It's big budget, it has some good acting, great innovative effects, costumes and so on. Great film. But then it was a very weak year (has been for a couple of years).Maybe it's that the sob scenes are SO calculated, that the effect or novelty is exposed 2nd/3rd time around. Maybe the flying prow scene just seemed too set-up. Maybe, truly, after seeing the film, the next time, or time after that, when you see it, you think of the real deal, the real ship, the real sinking, and wonder if the Irwin Allen treatment, here, isn't just a little too cynical and a little bit too much blood-money for the film-makers? I don't know.The 'docu-scenes' that bracket the film will probably hold up the best. The 'Heaven' scene depends on the emotion sweeping you up, and that of course is lost on repeat viewing (but that would be expected). If the film were about something fantastical, unbelievable, wild adventure or weird sci-fi, it could be viewed over and over without a thought given to reality. If it were a character play, from Jane Austen to Shakespeare, it could be repeatedly view precisely for the insights into reality, and appreciated for the fantasy, as well. But this is just Poseidon Adventure, with superficial character studies, and a quick sinking (cause it was) that leaves little time for Shelley Winters, er (whoever), to put in a 'just help me get off of this tub', performance (or was 'Jack' playing Shelley Winters? - ?).Almost gave the film away to a friend. Almost threw it out. Was surprized I still had it on the shelf. Don't plan to view it anytime soon.",
487,"Undoubtedly one of the greatest adventures of all time, an already great movie now even more spectacular in 3D. This whopper of a movie spans three hours of beautiful sets, incredible visuals and a stunning cast who deliver performances so strong that you immediately connect with their characters. I'm not one for love stories or romantic dramas but Titanic is simply a must-see, as it's blend of love, adventure and loss is incredible, and James Cameron is a master in suspense building. A few friends of mine say that they skip the first hour and a bit and just go straight to the sinking part, I told them that's ridiculous, and the reason being is that you won't care about who dies or the outcome at the end, you have to watch the whole movie, it's a breathless adventure that will live on and be remembered as a classic. Everybody knows the story, but now it's been re-mastered in 3D and it's even more alive. The moment you see the Titanic the crowds look even bigger as they sprawl alongside the docks, cranes lift boxes which appear to lift off the screen and the sweeping shots that pan over the ship are just incredible. The depth throughout the movie is vast and jaw dropping to look at. All dialogue scenes boast incredible spacing between every little object from cups to candles, and I love the scene where Jack holds Rose over the edge of the Titanic and holds her arms out, you can almost touch them, this is the best 3D conversion to ever grace Blu-Ray. He nailed Avatar in 3D, Sanctum was a stunner in 3D and now James Cameron has done it again. Then there's the climax, probably the most memorable and stunning climax in cinema history: The sinking of the Titanic. The scale here is mind blowing, as thousands of sailors and passengers flee in terror desperately trying to get on board the life boats, fighting for a space. I like how human nature and morals have been shown in this climax, how the crew leave the lower class people behind the shutters to drown which is saddening, and the greed and desperation of the upper class people fighting to get off the ship. The 3D here only heightens the terror, when passengers look over the sides the depth effects enable the viewer to tell just how far down the fall really is! The corridor scene where Rose and Jack try to flee is a marvel in 3D, don't get me wrong the 2D counterpart is spectacular still but the way the water seems to leak our your TV screen is frightening. This whole finale will have you on edge, once the ship itself tips and sinks the depth just goes into overdrive, look at the distance from where Rose hangs dangerously to beneath her. I will highly recommend this movie in 3D, if you are lucky enough to get your hands on the Blu-Ray like me then you are in for one hell of an experience. I don't really cry at movies, it takes an awful to get me weeping, even in real life situations but Titanic is a master tearjerker. For the last hour I honestly balled my eyes out, the soundtrack and score is wonderful as that peaceful vocal echoes in nearly every key scene. The four violin players stay to play their final performance as the ship goes down. The Captain goes back to wheel to go down with his ship. An elderly couple lye in bed as the water floods in. A single mother reads a bedtime story to her kids as their side of the ship goes down. Once the ship goes down more sad sets in. The sound of Rose frantically trying to shout for help, and when she lets go of Jack the tears start flooding in. This climax is hard hitting, lump-in-throat inducing and one heck of an emotional payoff. It gets sweeter when Old Rose drops her necklace into the Ocean, and when young Rose names herself Rose Dawson. This is as best as I can describe the beauty of the end. This classic story has never felt more alive, a fantastic conversion and still one of the epic movies of our time.",9
488,"I live in Southampton, the city where Jack and Rose embarked on the ill-fated Titanic. Many of the crew and the captain himself were from Southampton, many women were widowed and children left fatherless when the ship went down. It was a major tragedy for our city and my children went to school with children who descended from those who lost their lives. I felt a certain lack of respect was shown at times for the English crew, portrayed as bumbling and rude and this is unfair to the families left behind. Having said that the film was spectacular and I don't begrudge the love story of Jack and Rose, but when the ship started sinking I wasn't interested in seeing Cal chase the lovers through the ship, more attention should of been given to the disaster itself, the other people on board, but I still give it an 8 cos it made me cry.",8
489,"This film has three things to recommend it.1. The sinking ship.2. Nothing else.3. Wonderful acting - no not really, but there's a minimum line count for reviews so I had to write something.",
490,"Titanic is one of my favourite. Definitely not because of Jack and Rose's boring romance and blah blah blah.But due to the emotional and disastrous effect it made. It could be even better if the romance sequences were cut short.Nevertheless, its one of those classic movies not to be missed.",10
491,"This blockbuster is a milestone in film making and a career peak for Director/Producer James Cameron.  When this film bowled over the competition (except in acting and writing categories) at the Academy Awards,  it could be the occasion of a gleeful self-coronation (Mr. Cameron as ""King of the World"").  It had set box office records and was probably also record-breaking for multiple ticket purchases by teen fans of such a long epic.  Like its ""older sister"" GONE WITH THE WIND, this Best Picture Oscar-winner exists in a self-enclosed quasi-historical environment where the beautiful survive and thrive despite morally despicable transgressions. It claims to be ""inspired"" by actual events around the sinking and recent re-discovery at ocean's bottom. Those who love TITANIC feel that the mismatched couple outdo ""Romeo & Juliet"" as a most appealing ""eternal"" couple.  Teen fans of Leonardo DiCaprio would gladly throw caution to the wind as did the lead actress who poses nude quite immodestly.  As an unimpressed but still positive-minded fan of this movie overall, however, I have loads of questions to ask those who defend this as ""one of the all-time best movies"" (A.F.I. put it in the category of MOST THRILLING in its 2001 list recently).  For example, shouldn't a more specific disclaimer be attached to the closing credit acknowledgments about the ship's crew and captain who are ""transformed"" unnecessarily and untruthfully into brutish villains? Since real names of actual dead are attached to some ""inspired"" crew and passengers, attentive audience members assume that those historical people who deserve blame (like Bruce Ismay) are those who did kill and threaten others and otherwise act like the most wicked people ever.  Too many names can be exonerated and should be since this script took liberties with depicting the desperate, final actions of the crew.  As a second example, why doesn't Molly Brown get her lifeboat over to help those floating in life-jackets (in regular history, this IS (!) part of her claim to fame)?  Furthermore, what happened to Fabrizio in the film's middle?  How is it that the 100+ year-old is unsupervised at film's end?  Does the special effects wizardry paper over and rationalize the simplistic ""chase"" elements of the film's quite long middle?  I felt a bit confused whether the drowned victims were mostly ""caged in"" by the class-bigots among the fictional crew ""stewards"" or if they were just too slow in figuring out a strategy like the romantic couple had as the Titanic goes down for the third time.  Any help on these issues, Mr. Cameron and defenders of his script?  I didn't expect to know if time ""stood still"" when the ship takes on water but the film takes the ""worst spin"" on how the lifeboats get loaded and away in time to save only 1/3 of those aboard.  Were these numbers strictly correct? The facts could have been a little better adhered to, in my opinion. Again, this is an amazing entertainment product and a Hollywood legend's masterpiece.",9
492,"There is more wrong with this film than anyone could possibly say. I honestly don't know where to begin. Romance is bad. Reasons.1)I am not the most knowledgeable person when it comes to romance, but isn't there more to it than nude portraits and life saving? Also where is the attraction to a guy that looks like a woman? Yes Leonardo DiCrapio acts a little effeminately to be loved as Jack Dawson our so-called hero, or at least I think that is what everyone thought he was, he isn't at all, and you know why? It is simply because that if Rose Dawson (played badly by Kate Winslet, I'll explain later) hadn't known him she would have gone home happily without losing anyone close to her, and she wouldn't have jumped, no way would she, and if she had at least the film would have been over quicker, and also he is totally repulsive, especially to the male half of the audience, I mean really who is this film for?2) Attraction. I don't know how each character was attracted to each other. How can Jack be attracted to Rose when she is spitting over the side of the ship? That's disgusting even for me, never mind an effeminate person like him. Also if it's true love why didn't Rose make more room on the floating door, which she could've done easily. He might have lived if she had, heck even Jim Carrey spotted that in the film Bruce Almighty. Acting? Reasons why it is also crap.1) Winslet acts like a snob for the first part and then like a tramp, would anybody demote themselves like this? When the kid drowned in the corridor, and when she fell off the side of the boat she hardly screamed. Why? Some say she was strong. peh... Almost everyone would have screamed in those situations. I have no idea what her face expression and posture was meant to say when Leo was arrested for possessing the planted diamond, I think she was upset, maybe angry, maybe about ready to laugh? I do not know, she had NO EXPRESSION.2) Leo was the same, NO EXPRESSION. Cameron directed people to act like gormless puppets, one face for every situation. Totally unrealistic. 3) Rose's family of snobs were stereotypical, I don't like the stereotype at all. Snobs are not just money-grabbers, I am not particularly rich, but I'd like to be. With the way that each stereotype acted, it seemed that the poor wanted to stay poor, and the rich wanted to be richer. I don't think people really act like this. The directing is bad. Reasons.1) James Cameron couldn't direct traffic. His style is crap, and revolves around two kind of people a) People who have one prime desire, and nothing else, and this doesn't remotely resemble reality at all - b) The other group are people who have one stereotyped personality. These are mainly Snobs, the poor and the ship staff. James Cameron should have worked to establish more realism within his characters, only Kathy Bates can be praised for achieving this.2) The special effects are too lavish. The boat is too glammed up, and anyone who says the boat looks ""real"" is a total moron. A film needs to be more than special effects. He could have worked a little harder on the acting instead.3) Cameron's camera shots were mediocre to say the least. A few shots that were particularly bad include. The one where he shows us the whole ship from far out, I do not know what he was trying to achieve, my guess is that he was trying to show us how isolated the ship was, but this is pointless as we already knew it was isolated, you can't get more isolated in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Another example of camera shots is to do with the exchange of angles. He too often flickers back from person to person, why can't he keep the camera in one place? He may as well have pointed it at the moon, that's more interesting than a random mess of pictures. Bad plot. Reasons.It is meant to be Rose's story, and I think it should have only included her accounts. But instead it had bits that made no sense. such as.1)The two old people cuddling, getting ready to die. 2)Plates falling from shelves. 3)The captain drowning on the bridge. 4)The dome shatters and everyone inside drowns These events are shown, yet in accordance to where Rose is during the film it doesn't make sense that she should have known about these things. Why add bits? My guess is to add to the sentimentality and drama but the overall realism and straightforwardness is lost thanks to this. Boy I hate this film. Oscars? It Shouldn't have won a single solitary thing, never mind 11. There are flaws. Bigguns. No denying it really, it is totally true that almost every aspect could have been cleaned up considerably.I don't care what anyone says. I find it unbearable to watch this garbage. There is a lot more than this, wrong with this diabolical film, but I have a 1000 word limit. So all I can really say to conclude is that this film for me if not for you - SANK.",1
493,"I'm a sucker 4 romance, history and Leonardo DiCaprio, so this movie captivated me, it felt like u were there, on the doomed ship, the beauty and elegance of the 1st class captivated me while the fun and free steerage party made me want 2 dance. the romance was so carefully done and i loved it, the drawing was sensual and romantic-it was done so every single girl was left wishing their boyfriends were amazing artists as well. my only complaint was ""my heart will go on"" it was a cute song but Celine Dion-while writing it should not have sung it-sorry but she cant sing and with that one song has turned all my guy-friends from watching the movie (which sux because its my fave movie and now wen we watch movies at each others houses we cant watch titanic as they r now agsinst the soundtrack) when the ship is sinking its amazing the way you feel for the people falling off (except for the lady who slid down it and flashed everyone and the guy who fell off the end and fell on the propellers-those were funny and provided comic relief) but the way you just felt sad for the lady with the baby asking the captain for help, murdoch feeling helpless and shooting himself, fabritzio getting killed by the funnels and tommy Ryan getting shot. Kate Winslet gives an unforgettably performance and i suggest she dyes her hair that colour again because its so gorgeous. i loved what she wore and i bet every girl wishes they had her wardrobe (before the sinking obviously). Leonardo DiCaprio was impeccable as the (sexy) penniless artist who teaches rose how to love and gives her the courage to ""never let go"" this is a bawl your eyes out movie and is not to be missed",10
494,"It was the most amazing movie two years ago, but in 2000, the flawed fiction account of the most famous ship in history seems overstatingly unbelievable. Attempting to be faithful to fact while making Leonardo look overwhelmingly good to drag girls around my target age group to the box office now makes me embarrassed to be once part of the phenomenon that once was. Unfortunately, fact could not combine with romance on that one with a director who seemed more intent of running bills into the millions of dollars to break into the record books.I will not be entirely venomous towards the movie, because it was after all, at one stage, my favourite movie. Kate Winslet's performance was perhaps the best in the whole film, but her lower key and lower profiled Oscar nominated performance in ""Sense and Sensibility"" as Marianne still exceeds this one entirely. She has a knack for costume period drama in a good showy part, but she has done better work elsewhere.What once seemed to be perfection of movie making is quickly becoming evident with its misconceptions of film making. The screenplay at the time, and the musical score seemed completely breathtaking, but now merely looks the complete fluke that had enough star drawing power to get people to hand over their cash to the box office. Celine Dion assaulting the world with a maudlin ballad about a sinking ship of course increased the movie's success to a greater extent than it deserved. Perhaps the art decoration, costume design and cinematography will outlast some of the mediocre elements disguised beneath the surface of the gloss. The ""Titanic"" hype lasted long enough to secure a record equaling amount of Oscars first reached in 1959 with ""Ben-Hur"". During the 1990s, the Academy seemed to be handing the best picture statuette to the wrong pictures, with the exception of ""Schlindler's List"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Without a doubt, it will retain its place in history as a movie epic for all the generations. But it is certainly no ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""Casablanca"", and in sixty years we'll be wondering what we were thinking.
Rating: 5/10",5
495,"Evidently the reputation of this blockbuster continues to nosedive, like the ship, and like DiCaprio's standing as he loses his teenybopper following. He has failed to grow out of his chrysalis (will he ever? Tom Cruise is pushing 40 and still coming on like a 20 year old). I feel the movie sets up quite an intriguing fictional frame quite skilfully in the first 20-odd minutes- not unlike 'King Kong'- and then blows it the moment Rose's mother utters the words we're all praying not to hear: ""They say she's unsinkable"". More's the pity, this comes just after the amusing tease of not showing Rose as she alights from the cab until we've peered under her big Edwardian hat.From then on, dialogue cliches, anachronisms, falsifications of historical fact, national stereotypes and the absurdities and contrivances of the plot pile up until the film's credibility is foundering long before the vessel does. Why do the lovers make out in a car (is this a first?) when she could have smuggled him into her stateroom with its four-poster bed? Note too how in between their 1990s-style bursts of nookie the star-crossed pair manage to be on hand for every plot development. It's Rose who quizzes an admiring Andrews about the lifeboats' capacity, and she and Jack are snogging at the very moment of impact- which is far more juddery than in reality, since few passengers noticed it. Somehow Rose wades through freezing water for minutes on end, clad in her filmy dress, without taking any harm: I know Dame Winslet's naturally well insulated, but not even a sneeze?It's beyond a joke when Murdoch, a gallant officer, is smeared as a corrupt suicide: Cameron had to pay $8,000 to charity to make up for that bit of hokum. But many of the errors are venial, and some grisly enjoyment can be drawn from the spectacle of multiple death, just as a little can be had from the curiously cursory contemplation of the ship's luxurious appointments in the earlier scenes, which experts have warranted authentic.On the whole, though, sitting through these three hours feels like being forced to drink an enormous, sickly cocktail. For relief, try the pure draught of iceberg-cold water provided by the British antidote: Eric Ambler's and Roy Ward Baker's 'A Night to Remember', which sticks to documentary reconstruction and distils more pity, terror and catharsis than Mr Cameron's $200m budget and tin ear could begin to generate.PS: When people rave about 'Titanic's' box office- as if numbers guaranteed quality- tell them that inflated 1997 ticket prices are responsible for most of it. Tickets sold ('bums on seats') for the great popular epics of the past, such as 'Gone with the Wind', were far more numerous.",
496,Titanic Released in 1997 to me this movie is very long some of the effects are dated and yea it didn't age well yes you can tell were the CGI is there are a couple of times were stuntdobles apare there is a Secne were you can see the end of the set the most memorable thing about this movie is when Jack Yell's I'm the king of the world.,10
497,"If only James Cameron could write dialogue!  This is a well-produced fictionalization of the Titanic and her maiden voyage, with all the historical details just right (well, except for some really minor stuff ...).  The romantic story overlaying it all lends poignancy and drew in the crowds, in record numbers.  The performances are, by and large, good-to-excellent, except for Leonardo DiCaprio, who did much better in his earlier movies (up to and including The Quick and the Dead), and Billy Zane, who's never been able to do more than look like a movie star.Cameron is a great director of action, and a good visual story teller.  Too bad he's such a control freak, he ought to allow someone to re-write all his dialogue so that it sounds like humans talking, not T-1000's. 
I give this a ""five"" only because the ""seven"" it's currently averaged at is too high.",6
498,"TITANIC Titanic is one of the year's best films. The story is based on actual events of the tragic Titanic voyage. Since everyone knows what happens to the Titanic, James Cameron adds a interesting twist to the story. A ship in the present sends a probe into the Titanic to locate a diamond but instead finds a picture of a naked lady. The lady who is in the drawing calls the man who found the picture. She tells her story about her time spent on the Titanic.There is a lot interesting scenes in the movie in addition to being powerful and dramatic. It is a very long movie but the time passes so well that you don't even notice that much. The shots of the Titanic in some scenes were quite good. This movie is definitely a must see especially on the big screen. Rated PA",10
499,"Titanic is my favourite film off all time. I can watch this film night after night and never get bored of it. Every time I watch it I feel like I experience a range off different emotions to the previous time watching it. Titanic is just such a beautiful thing it really does win the heart of the audience, the film makes you cry and laugh it is a tale of history and romance. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Jack Dawson a character you can't help but fall in love with. This is one of James Cameron's brilliant pieces of work. I would recommend this film to anyone, It is beyond me how people can say they don't like this film I mean what is not to like?",10
500,"What movie comes to mind when you think of compelling, memorable characters, spectacular visual effects, a fantastic score, and a beautiful, tragic plot? What movie has captured the hearts and imagination of people of all ages around the world? What movie has retained its charm and ­appeal for over a decade, and has earned a rightful place in cinematic history? The answer is Titanic, the 1997 film that opened with low expectations and then astounded the public with its massive success. As the highest-grossing film of all time and winner of 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, Titanic raises hopes for moviegoers and does not disappoint.First, consider an undertaking so daunting that many would deem it impossible: recreating the RMS Titanic and its fateful sinking. This task undoubtedly required much time, skill, and effort, not to mention a huge budget – at the time, Titanic was the most expensive film ever made. The ship's splendor shines throughout the movie and adds an atmosphere of magic that film sets rarely manage.Another element of the film's success is the superb, talented cast. Most notably, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet give commanding performances as Jack and Rose, the young star-crossed lovers separated by ­social class on the maiden voyage of the doomed vessel. They are cast perfectly; a better choice could not have been made. Along with the rest of the cast, including Billy Zane as Rose's wicked fiancé and Gloria Stuart as Rose at age 101, they allow the audience to join their journey and share in their emotions and experiences. By the conclusion, viewers feel very close to the characters and truly care about them, which is why the movie is so poignant and tragic.So many years after its theatrical release, Titanic still has not lost what made it such a success. This moving, simply beautiful story about fate, disaster, and the power of love has proved to be a timeless classic and an epic masterpiece.",10
501,"`Titanic' has a large number of fans that will cheerfully proclaim that it is the best movie ever made, and a large number of detractors who will cheerfully proclaim that is nothing but puerile, overrated garbage.  The truth lies somewhere in between - `Titanic' definitely shouldn't have won the Best Picture Oscar in 1997 (), but to dismiss the film as utter crap is very unfair.  `Titanic' tells a complex tale, and, for the most part, tells it very well.  The fact that parts of this tale are either predictable or flawed shouldn't be ignored, but it also isn't enough to turn `Titanic' into a rotten movie. `Titanic' has a slightly predictable story, but most films involving a well-known historical event tend to be predictable.  Before the movie even starts, anybody watching `Titanic' should be able to predict a few things: The Titanic will set sail in glorious fashion, with its owners grandly proclaiming its unsinkable nature; there will be a story about the passengers, some fictional, some real; the Titanic will sink in a slow and horrible fashion; and while the ship sinks, the characters will be forced to deal with their own mortality, and some will be heroes while others will be craven cowards.  See?  Predictable.  It doesn't take a genius to realize that the historical nature of `Titanic' dictates this story structure. After all, it's the structure James Cameron actually uses.  But the execution of that structure . . . well, that takes some talent, if the film has any aspirations of being good.  It means blending action, romance, drama, and historical accuracy.  And James Cameron blends them all splendidly.The main story concerns a young girl named Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), traveling to America in order marry an arrogant millionaire named Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).  The marriage, which has been arranged by her formerly rich and now-destitute mother (Frances Fisher), is abhorrent to Rose, so in a desperate attempt to escape her fate, she attempts to jump off the ship.  Of course, she doesn't jump, but is instead saved by the happy-go-lucky Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), and of course the two begin a brief, if implausible, romance.  This romance, which is perhaps the weakest part of `Titanic' is still vitally important to the story . . . because it gives the audience a very strong reason to care about these characters when the ship hits the iceberg, and about the choices they make. Could it have been better?  Absolutely.  But considering that the romance is a means to an end, rather than the end itself, it's not bad.DiCaprio is superb as the wide-eyed vagabond Jack Dawson - he brings enough earnest enthusiasm to the role to make it totally believable as to why Rose would fall in love so quickly with him.  Winslet's slightly less believable, though; she's good, but not great.  She puts in a nice, quiet, restrained performance, but it's so restrained at times that it borders on comatose. It's actually the minor characters that add some zip to `Titanic' - Billy Zane is outstanding as the villain Hockley, as he gives Hockley enough human nuances to make him seem like a flawed, arrogant person, and not just some standard bad guy ripped straight out of a Flash Gordon serial.  Also worthy of note is the modern-day interaction between deep-sea explorer Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) and the elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart), floating on an exploration ship far above the watery grave of the Titanic.  No only does their interaction serve as a brilliant, unobtrusive way of relaying the historical facts about the Titanic's final hours to the audience, but Paxton also manages to become a surrogate for the audience - as the movie unfolds and gets more and more interesting, it's a neat touch to see his character Lovett become more and more fascinated with Rose's stories.It would be remiss not to mention the special effects of `Titanic', which by and large is the film's strength. While the ship (and its sinking) is a product of CGI effects and model works, it's done it such a realistic manner that it never calls attention to itself, or reminds the audience that they're watching a movie. Of more importance is that the film's effects, while spectacular, never ARE the film - they always SUPPORT the film's story.There are many things to nit-pick about `Titanic' (although I find it hard to believe that people really nit-pick the minor historical inaccuracies of the film; Cameron got all the major details right, and the films probably more than 95% accurate, for crying out loud).  But those problems are nit-picks - very tiny but slightly irritating details, nothing more.  They keep the film from being an all-time great, but they certainly don't make it a bad film.  The blend of romance, action, history, and special effects probably explains the film's vast appeal - there's certainly something for everyone in this film - and it also makes `Titanic' an excellent, if not perfect, movie.  Grade: B+",7
502,"I loved Titanic a lot. I wasn't around when the Titanic actually sank. But this movie made me glad i wasn't around to see it. The artwork and the storyline really keeps you wanting more and more from this film. The acting was pretty good and the love couple of Jack and Rose definitely didn't make this movie boring because i wanted to see what would have happened in the end when the ship would have sank. Some very minors things with the movie was that the acting was a bit corny in a couple of areas, and the fact that they didn't go a bit more into detail with the characters but doesn't make it bad in anyway what so ever. Another impressive is that after 10 years people are still talking about how great this movie is, and for some reason you haven't seen it yet, GO WATCH IT NOW!!!",9
503,"Ok ok ok... There is nothing wrong with Leo Di Caprio except that us guys wish we had his looks... His acting in Titanic was sub-par, but I've seen him do very excellent jobs in This Boy's Life and Romeo and Juliet, so I can't knock him for one average job. I've also seen Winslet do a better job, despite her Oscar nomination. James Cameron is a great special effects director, and I think some day people will look at him as one of the great influences of 1980's and 90's popular film. I enjoyed the film, although I did not LOVE it, but that's ok. The music was appropriate, if a little overdone, but the romance was great. No, I am not a fan of romance, but obviously for millions of girls out there it was VERY effective. Bravo to Cameron, and if it made more money than some of us think it deserved, well, that's showbusiness!",6
504,"Because IMDb has too many fanboys who think Batman should be the top rated film of all-time, movies like Titantic will never succeed here. Great storytelling, a historical background, good acting, excellent directing, great special effects and a beautiful soundtrack.. Titantic won all those Oscars and is the highest grossing film of all-time. I don't think anyone involved with it will lose any sleep on how it's rated at this site. I loved it when it came out and still watch it a lot.. It's the type of film that makes being a movie fan a joy. It's film making at it's best and no moron trying to put it down will ever change that.",10
505,"Greetings again from the darkness. Of course I saw this one a couple of times when it was first released in 1997. Having only watched it once since, I was happy to hear it would get a re-release on its 15th anniversary ... even if the marketing hook was the post-production 3D. My thought was with James Cameron working his technical magic, the 3D would be fine, and maybe even add to the spectacle of the sinking ship. After all, he was the mastermind behind Avatar, which with Hugo, are the only two films (in my opinion) that haven't been weakened with 3D technology.Unfortunately, I can't overstate my disappointment in the 3D for Titanic. The colors and lighting are destroyed. When we first see young Rose (Kate Winslet) arrive to board the majestic ocean liner, her lavender hat appears almost gray through the 3D glasses. And later, the crimson Renault, where Rose and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) get to ""know"" each other, appears dull and darkened. Additionally so many face shots are darkened, rather than illuminated by the beautiful fixtures that adorn Titanic. I was so saddened to see such dullness on top of such greatness. Sure, there were a couple of times where the 3D gave a boost to a special effect, but the film is so beautifully made and such a technical marvel, that the impact is minimal to the positive.What I will say is that despite my frustration with the technology, I do hope a new generation is introduced to the film. Personally, I am no fan of the love story between Jack and Rose. However, it is such a delight to see the young, eager versions of Little Leo and Kate as they go about their antics. They were 22 and 21 respectively during filming, and we now know them as mature actors and major movie stars. That wasn't the case when Titanic first premiered.The real genius of this film is two fold: the story-telling and the technical achievement. Gloria Stuart stars as 101 yr old Rose and she is used to perfection in telling the personal story of Titanic. Her love story with Jack allows director Cameron to show off the amazing ship from all angles ... first class, third class, dining rooms and engine rooms. She also allows the viewer to connect with the characters on a personal level. The technical aspect is even more astounding. Sets, models, CGI, and documentary footage are all blended to form a cohesive presentation of one of the most dramatic events of the past 100 years.Here are a few notes of interest regarding the movie and those involved. The movie was number one at the box office for 15 consecutive weeks and grossed more than $1.8 billion ... a record that stood until Cameron's Avatar eclipsed it. Cameron was already an established sci-fi director with Terminator I & II and Aliens, but he almost had the plug pulled by the production company due to cost overruns. Matthew McConaughey was the producer's first choice for Jack, but Cameron held firm for DiCaprio. The elderly couple hugging each other in bed as the ship sinks were based on the Strauss' who owned the Macy's department store chain. And yes, there were Astor's and Guggenheim's onboard when it went down. If you have seen the movie before, pay particular attention to the secondary characters ... the wardrobes and acting are tremendous: Francis Fisher as Rose's mother, Karthy Bates as the ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown, Billy Zane as the fiancé, David Warner as his henchman, Bernard Hill as the Captain, Victor Garber as the architect, and Jonathan Hyde as the sleazy ship owner. Also catch Suzy Amis in one of her last acting jobs before becoming Mrs. James Cameron ... she plays the granddaughter to ""old"" Rose.This is an historic film version of an historic event and should be seen by all movie lovers. Some of it is a bit hokey, but if you doubt the technical achievement, compare it to A Night to Remember, the 1958 version of the Titanic story.",8
506,"A fellow reviewer wrote earlier that Titanic is among his or her favorite films, and sometimes people laugh. I myself laugh, not at the movie but at that statement. I echo what the reviewer said, which is that at the time, almost everyone loved the movie or at least recognized good stuff about it. It was critically acclaimed, made more money than any movie in history, and received uncountable awards including the most Oscars ever, tied with Ben Hur at 11 wins.Now, I shake my head when I see that Titanic currently has a rating of about 6.7.  Jeez people, view a movie for how it is rather than how oversaturated it got!!!And that's the problem. Titanic WAS a very good movie- and since I was interested in the actual ship a decade before the movie was made, hopefully I can tell you why I support it. The technical achievements alone were grand, the scale of the movie was epic and moving, and to James Cameron's credit, it was almost 100% accurate to the many different details of the Titanic legend. Of course, to accept this one has to ignore the fact that the main characters are fictitious amalgams of real Titanic passengers.Those two characters are Jack Dawson and Rose Buttaker, played of course by the leads Dicaprio and Winslet. Their awkward meeting and subsequent falling in love is played against the oncoming disaster, which, as everyone should know, happened 4 days into the ship's first voyage. At 11:40pm on April 14, 1912, the Titanic hit an iceberg and sank 2 and a half hours later.Now for the movie itself. The acting, although passionate, is goofy at times due to a script that was much maligned as being stereotypical and bland. I don't hate it that much, it doesn't sound too far off from what people are like when they're stupid in love. However, my problem arises here: Rose seems to be witty and independent, yet she becomes a doe-eyed child when she falls for Jack, who seems to know the answer to everything and even needs to heroically command Rose to ""get back"" when the iceberg comes by. More and more their relationship turns from possible to downright one-dimensional, as Jack becomes a grand hero and Rose becomes a helpless damsel. Granted, each character has scenes where they betray that limit (Rose in fact saves Jack's life at one point), but that's an exception to the rule. Another problem is that, quite simply, a relationship between a first class woman and third class male is possible, although entirely improbable. People just weren't that open minded in 1912, although for this movie it doesn't seem too severely hard to swallow.That having been said, I don't have much of a problem with the rest of the movie. This is because it stays admirably close to the facts, and pays insane amounts of detail to each scene. Director Cameron was in fact often joked about due to his fierce, almost anal commitment to the details. The ship looks real, because most of it is. The band played until the very end, which they really did. The ship indeed broke in half at the 2nd funnel, and if you look close, the iceberg scrape actually dots and dents the ship's hull instead of tearing a solid gash, as it actually did in real life. Although the 1958 Titanic film ""A Night to Remember"" had no fictitous characters and sticks religiously close to what really happened, James Cameron's Titanic is technically the most accurate, especially due to the breaking of the ship which wasn't proven until after the former film was made. A couple technical slips do get by, such as a terrible blue screen effect seen when the drunken baker is standing atop the risen stern (just before the final sinking). There's a shot of victims rolling down the upright stern section near the end, and we can see one of them bounce off of the cylindrical capstans, obviously a soft prop. But hey, these are just gaffes in an otherwise very good technical achievement.In closing, I still like this movie, as I did when it first came out (though not nearly as much now, after a dozen viewings). It has a lot of emotional impact, it stays very, very close to the actual facts, and it can even be argued that although fictional, Jack and Rose are just an example of what really happened to many of the couples on the real ship when it went down. I don't think a better movie about the Titanic can be made, although the aforementioned ""Night to Remember"" is also extremely good and in many ways just like James Cameron's film. If you see Titanic, the film, for what it tried to achieve, you can see that it is in fact a well made and successful film. I know it's hard to get past the negativity that its oversaturation caused, but at its heart I think it is an excellent movie.",10
507,"The hype surrounding James Cameron's ""Titanic"" when it was released during Christmas, 1997, and early 1998 was so great that it worked against the film in a way. Few films could live up to such ballyhoo. Nevertheless, viewing it apart from the mass hoopla, it shines in all-around greatness.The movie of course details the doomed maiden voyage of the magnificent Titanic from April 10-15, 1912. This is one of the greatest tragedies in human history. There were only enough lifeboats for half of the over 2200 men, women and children aboard. Why? Because the Titanic was so great they thought she was unsinkable. When it was all over only a little over 700 people survived and 1500 people went to their grave in the cold North Atlantic.This is a movie and not a documentary and, as such, includes a fictional drama to hook the viewer. This is where people will either embrace the film or criticize it. As far as I'm concerned, the story of Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet) is excellent. Rose is only 17 years old and is being forced by her fearful mother (Frances Fisher) to marry the pompously rich Cal (Billy Zane). Jack, by contrast, is a dirt poor wandering artist who's free as the wind and brims with life, love, and humble honesty.Rose instinctively feels trapped and would rather die than marry some fake snob, no matter how handsome and wealthy. She's attracted to Jack because he's the antithesis of Cal. By contrast, her mother views Jack as a threat because she thinks that her only hope of retaining the airs of wealth is through marrying her daughter into a rich family. The ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) is another significant personality. She's new enough to ""high society"" to still relate to the ""commoners"" and so goes out of her way to help Jack and his brushes with the stuffy aristocracy. Thrown into the mix is Cal's priceless diamond necklace for Rose and what happens to it.Speaking of which, there's a modern story (1996 anyway) that brackets the main plot. Bill Paxton stars as a treasure hunter obsessed with the necklace, Suzy Amis as Rose's granddaughter and Gloria Stuart as old-aged Rose. Gloria was 85-86 years old during filming and she just shines in the role.The casting and acting is exceptional, particularly the main performers. It's no wonder that DiCaprio and Winslet went on to great success. In addition, the depictions of the vessel and her tragic sinking are magnificent.Yet it's the powerful subtext that inspires most. What good is great wealth without love, virtue, respect and freedom? In her untainted teenage idealism, Rose would rather die than have this. Jack lacks the former but possesses the latter and, therefore, possesses the former as well, even if you can't see it (if you know what I mean). Rose instinctively senses this and therefore throws all caution to the wind. Some criticize that she goes too far by prematurely getting intimate in the vehicle, but – remember – she grew-up with her life-stifling, greedy, fear-mongering mother and so when she finally gets away from her clutches she naturally goes overboard. Have some compassion! As for the fate of the necklace (***SPOILER***), Rose didn't cash-in on the diamond because she didn't want to rely on Cal for money; and she didn't give it to her granddaughter or the treasure-hunter because it wasn't hers to give. Since the insurance company paid out on the policy Cal's dad took out on it, the diamond belonged to the insurance company if found; it was no longer the property of Hockley or his heirs, and it wasn't the property of Rose either, because it was not made over to her by a deed of gift or a bequest. She came into possession of it by mistake and so was obligated by law to turn it over to the rightful owners or, if that was not possible, to legal authorities. More importantly, the necklace was a reminder of her promise to Jack to ""Never let go."" She thus throws it into the ocean because she had fulfilled her promise to live life to the fullest and was now ready let go, particularly since she finally returned to Jack's watery grave (***END SPOILER***).It wouldn't be right to fail to acknowledge the great score by James Horner and the theme song sung by Celine Dion. Great movies are great because their producers take the time & effort to achieve excellence on every level.Needless to say, because the film runs 3 hours and 14 minutes you have to be in the mood for a long movie to fully appreciate ""Titanic.""GRADE: A",9
508,"First off, this was a rather good flick for me.  Nothing to great...I have seen a lot of films since I have seen this one that I like a heck of a lot more, but this was pretty good.  A love story set on the Titanic is basically the story with a few plot points about class.  Seeing the ship sink of course is the highlight for me cause it really did look good.  I saw the actors did alright...I won't badger Leo, I don't hold anything against a guy just because lots of gals like him, I just call him a lucky bast#rd and be done with it.  Kate looks pretty good in this flick and does a rather good job as well.  Like I said though the boat sinking is the highlight and one complaint I have is that there wasn't enough character developement of other characters besides Leo's and Kate's...I have posted some theories on why I think it grossed so much on the message board here, because frankly I think it was a fluke it did gross so much, but I am not saying it was a bad flick.",8
509,"I went to see ""Titanic"" for Leonardo DeCaprio - so what? (Heck I'd already seen Kate Winslet naked in ""Jude."" What - so guys don't go to the movies to see a certain ""Pretty Woman""? But it was inappropriate that people brought kids, what with kids talking and asking questions through the whole movie and the parents commenting back. This is a big Hollywood extravaganza but it doesn't mean that kids should be there as if it were ""Men in Black.""It's selling out every showing in my neighborhood. So it's the most expensive movie ever made. It's what Hollywood is good at regardless of where it was filmed and what other things could be achieved in this world with all that money. (originally written 1/4/1998)",9
510,"I once had a dream.  A vision, if you will.  I had the idea that when I died at age 92, on my tombstone would be the words ""LAST WOMAN ON EARTH TO NEVER SEE TITANIC."" I thought I could do it. But, just as the Unsinkable Ship took a swift nosedive to the ocean floor, I too, hit an iceberg, and in a moment of weakness, watched The Epic. I was the out-spoken, Titanic-bashing zealot who claimed ""it couldn't possibly be that good! It's all effects!"" Well, my attitude hasn't changed much. Now, with my melted resolve, I ask, what was all the hype about? The ""I'm king of the world!"" was just too much. I suppose knowing Leo was going to turn Human Popsicle sort of ruined the moment, too.  The effects were impressive, but I just didn't feel involved. Yes, Leo's a looker, and I assume men say the same of Kate, but I was looking for something more.",
511,"I like Leonardo DiCaprio, I think he was excellent as Jack Dawson, and I think too that he deserved at least an Oscar nomination for his work. ""Titanic"" deserved to win Best Picture, and I really don't care what sort of flak I'd probably get for saying all that, but I like ""Titanic"". I was 12 when I saw it, and I remember clear as day being touched by it. It may be tacky, sappy, or just plain unbelievable, but ""Titanic"" is one of the more memorable movies I've seen. It's basically mindless entertainment brought to life by a group of actors who can really act (DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, etc). It's mindless entertainment that tells a rather corny but moving tale of two people brought together and torn apart by fate, and it's mindless entertainment that just *happened* to make millions at the box office, and just *happened* to scoop Oscars left and right. What are you going to do about that?What I like about ""Titanic"" is the simplicity of its plot (yes, it has one). I hate to reiterate, but a story about two different individuals falling in love while they're on the legendary Titanic doesn't get anymore complicated than that. Call me a sap if you must, but my attempts at swallowing the huge lump I had in my throat when the film concluded were futile; one cannot help but be touched by Jack's sacrifice for Rose. And it also helps that there's real chemistry between DiCaprio (who's a truly gifted actor) and Winslet, and again, you can't help but want them to be together. I usually stay away from romance films as a lot of them are crap and have retarded plots, but ""Titanic"" is an exception. It's 3 hours long, and throughout those 3 hours, there's not a boring minute.Let me first declare that my admiration for DiCaprio has got nothing to do with looks. I have just recently became a huge fan of his, and if it's got to do with looks, shouldn't I be obsessed (for lack of a better word) with him 3 years ago? Having that said, despite what a lot of people think, DiCaprio is more than a teen idol or a pretty boy with no acting talent. Jack Dawson may not be an awfully hard character to play, but DiCaprio excelled in his role, like he always does. He's one of the most talented actors of his generation (others include Joaquin Phoenix), and his works before ""Titanic"" should more or less prove that.Something to ponder about: If ""Titanic"" was an independent movie with a budget of much less than what it had, would you hate it too?",9
512,"In 1912, the RMS Titanic is ready to set sail for New York across the Atlantic as we see Rose (Kate Winslet) who is engaged to a snobby chump named Cal (Billy Zane). As the ship sails off, Rose in many respects feels like a prisoner wanting to follow her own path. Due to her depression, she attempts to kill herself by jumping off the ship's stern. But luckily a person named Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) saves her and both fall in love. But then fate appears in the form of a iceberg as the ship hits the berg on the starboard side. While the ship is said to be unsinkable, she is unable to cobble the deadly forces of nature as she begins to sink.In my opinion this is James Cameron's best movie next to the two Terminator movies. The characters are very likable. Jack Dawson is my favorite character and he's a good-hearted person. It's also very funny when he swears. Rose is more of the main character in the movie. For one of her first roles, Kate Winslet really does a bang-up job in her performance. She could whip butt and I find her very loving. Billy Zane's character is much a abusive butthole and tried to kill the main characters. My favorite moment is the drawing scene and I learned that James Cameron actually drew the picture. Aside from the Titanic sinking, the most heartbreaking moment is when Jack dies and I cried my eyes out. The music here is made by the late James Horner and I absolutely loved it. Overall this is the greatest Hollywood movies and fun to watch.I'll give it a 9/10.",9
513,"This is a May 2020 update, as I have watched this maybe 5 or 6 times over the years, most recently last night. Yes, it is long, and they probably spend too much time showing the carnage during the actual sinking, but after I start watching it and become immersed yet again the time figuratively flies.For a movie that was made almost 25 years ago it holds up extremely well in picture and sound. Dicaprio and Winslet are of course marvelous in their roles but for me Billy Zane is the best here, the way he plays the demanding rich American taking his British teenage fiancee back home, only to be interrupted by the carefree Jack who presents a completely different outlook on life.Say what you want about James Cameron, the person, but he did a masterful job of weaving together several different stories, including the elderly modern day Rose telling her story after Jack's charcoal drawing is recovered from the wreckage 2 1/2 miles under the surface of the Atlantic. Even just the modern day images of the real Titanic wreckage add immeasurably to the impact of the whole movie.This will remain a classic for many decades to come, well deserving of its various awards.",
514,"I loved this movie since I was 7 and I saw it on the opening day. It was so touching and beautiful. I strongly recommend seeing for all. It's a movie to watch with your family by far.My MPAA rating: PG-13 for thematic elements, prolonged scenes of disastor, nudity/sexuality and some language.",10
515,Not often you see a film where the leading man is prettier than the leading woman. The best performance in it is from Gloria Stuart as the old woman. David Warner does a very good impression of Leo G. Carroll. Kathy Bates is impressive and so is the ship. I found Dame Kate and Leonardo thoroughly uninteresting.,3
516,"I've seen some shockers in my time, but this excuse for a film takes the cake.  I had some respect for Cameron and Winslet before this one, but all that was ruined by Titanic.  Easily the Academy's biggest mistake of recent years, and certainly the aforementioned film stars. (I had little respect for DiCaprio, however, so he isn't tainted any more) Billy Zane must have been desperate, as even if he's not the best actor around, he's still a popular choice for me. A script that couldn't have been recycled into toilet paper, combined with bad acting and a bad story make Titanic a disaster, rather than a disaster movie.  For a good romance, check The Princess Bride, and for disaster, see a good war movie - try Gallipoli.",1
517,"This movie is a masterpiece. Dont unterstand the low rating, its a shame.",10
518,"I have been fascinated by the story of the White Star Line's most luxurious liner that sank on her maiden voyage, ever since I first learned of it 20 years ago, and my Dad would always say ""And they STILL don't know where she came to rest..."" Remember, it wasn't until 1985 when National Geographic found the wreck.I have many books, articles, and video programs about the history of the RMS Titanic, it's people, and it's impact on the entire world following the tragedy.When Cameron's ""Titanic"" debuted in the theater, all I heard was how great the love story was. I didn't think that any film that put fictional characters in a real setting, especially one as dramatic as the Titanic disaster could succeed. I was wrong.""Titanic"" is an excellent film in all respects. Both DiCaprio and Winslet have a realistic and charismatic chemistry with each other. Kathy Bates was born to play the role of Molly Brown, Billy Zane is wonderfully despicable as the intended husband for Winslet, and Bernard Hill lends a great deal of respect to his role as Captain John Smith.But the real star is indeed, the ship itself. It is absolutely phenomenal how the filmmakers recreated the legendary ship for the film. The grand staircase with the carving of hope and glory crowning time, the staterooms, the ballroom, the smoking lounges, all replicated with incredible attention to detail.The details surrounding the sinking were incredible as well. I believe this is the first motion picture to address the fact that the ship split in half as it sank, instead of going down whole. The entire sinking sequence is incredibly chilling and you will not be able to turn your eyes away from it.If you are one of the few that have not yet seen Titanic, watch it soon, and see if it doesn't amaze and move you.And by the way... if you find yourself in Orlando, FL, check out the Titanic exhibition. You won't be disappointed.",10
