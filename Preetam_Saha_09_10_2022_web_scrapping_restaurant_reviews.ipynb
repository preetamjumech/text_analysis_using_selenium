When I clicked on Google Maps to check the route, it informed me that this was my fourth visit (not counting earlier visits when I did not have Maps on my phone!)The first thing which strikes one is the heritage building and the decor which tries to match the exterior. Recently they have redecorated the ground floor and have put some old furinture and artefacts on display, including an old typewriter of \"Corona\" brand. The first floor, where the seating capactiy seems to expand each time we visit, is relatively recent. The decor seems a bit overdone, but as soon as the food arrives, the decor recedes into the background. Coming to the food, we began with mocktails with interesting names like Noti Binodini and Professor Shanku, along with the Mochar Chop and Chhana Motorshutir Chop as starters. For the main course, we had Shuktoni and two types of Dal with Luchi and steamed rice. The highlight of our meal was the Bhetki Paturi, and its vegetarian version the Nabaratna Paturi (as our group had both vegetarians and non-vegetarians). As for desserts, all of us declared that we had overeaten, but we finally ordered nolen gurer ice cream and bhapa doi. Both were outstanding and were specially enjoyed by our guests who were visiting the restaurant for the first time. The food and service were equally good. I must also appreciate the clean and well equipped washrooms. It is likely that the fifth visit will take place very soon!Show less',\n",

The Chitol Machh was rubbery like soy bean and, worse still, the curry was quite undistinguished. I don\\'t know what happened. Perhaps the chef had a bad day.My overall recommendation is to avoid this restaurant. There are several other Bengali food joints with very tasty food.Visited on April 9, 2022 at 1:30 PM. Table #18. The restaurant can verify my comment against their order book.Show less',\n",
              " \"It's not a bad restaurant, but definitely not out of this world. It has been able to get hyped by local Bongs more than it deserves. Food is just good. I repeat, just good. Fish fry we tried was ordinary, there are hundreds of restaurants in Kolkata serving better stuff. Mocktail range is good. Overall, it's good. Show less\",\n",
              " \"Out of all of the numerous restaurants I've visited throughout India and the world, 6 Ballygunge Place has the best, and most authentic Bengali food I've ever had at a restaurant. As a Bengali living abroad, it tasted home cooked - highly, highly recommend for the discerning traveller in search of a truly memorable experience.Show less\",\n",
              " 'This is one place where you get the true delicacies of Bengal. It is big and accomodates many guests. There was a plethora of dishes for buffet lunch when we visited. It included Veg, Fish, Prawns, chicken, mutton and dessert. a la carte also available.',\n",
              " 'We went for dinner at the newly opened 6, Ballygunge place at Chowringhee. They are at Chaudhary Estates property. The restaurant is reasonably large, well lit and spread out. It wasn’t crowded ( maybe b’cos they are new at Chowringhee). The service was attentive and unobtrusive. The captain and waiters know about the dishes and their details and explained them to us( we are not conversant with Bengali language), though we know about the cuisine. We tried fish kabiraji , chandernagore fried fish, koi macher jhol, kosha magsho and poshto in veg. The desserts were also awesome. The best part is, they live up to their reputation for quality. The preparations were made well maintaining quality and taste. They have good variety of veg and non veg items. Worth a visit if you’re with family or friends.Show less',\n",
              " \"Their afternoon buffet has really gone southwards. I remember having it 3 years ago and it was a great experience. Yesterday's buffet lunch was just passable, and barely value for money. The servers were very reluctant to refill the dishes that we wanted, namely mutton curry and fish fry. It was quite obvious that they were scrimping and hoping that we would let it pass.Show less\",\n",
              " '6 Ballygunge Place was the perfect place for a family reunion. Great ambience, good food and service. Posto bora, Chicken Tampa... , Chutney, Fish fry , Baked Mihidana were superb. Bhapa Ilish was good quality but lacked the zing. Suggest to add a dash of raw Mustard oil before serving and some slit green chillies. RJ and Dhanjoy were a big help in curating the menu. Thank you to the wonderful staff.Show less']"
